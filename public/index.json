[{"content":"1.1 When to use asyncio? Asyncio is a library to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax. It is a single-threaded, single-process design that is ideal for I/O-bound and high-level structured network code. It is not suitable for CPU-bound code, which is better handled by the multiprocessing module.It is used for :\n2.1 Coroutine Think of a coroutine like a regular Python function but with the superpower that it can pause its execution when it encounters an operation that could take a while to complete. When that long-running operation is complete, we can “wake up” our paused coroutine and finish executing any other code in that coroutine. While a paused coroutine is waiting for the operation it paused for to finish, we can run other code. This running of other code while waiting is what gives our application concur rency. We can also run several time-consuming operations concurrently, which can give our applications big performance improvements. To both create and pause a coroutine, we’ll need to learn to use Python’s async and await keywords. The async keyword will let us define a coroutine; the await key word will let us pause our coroutine when we have a long-running operation.\n2.2 Creating a coroutine with async creating a coroutine is straightforward and not much different from creating a nor mal Python function. The only difference is that, instead of using the def keyword, we use async def. The async keyword marks a function as a coroutine instead of a nor mal Python function.\nimport asyncio async def mero_coroutine(): print(\u0026#34;Hello From Asyncio\u0026#34;) The coroutine in the preceding listing does nothing yet other than print “Hello world!” It’s also worth noting that this coroutine does not perform any long-running operations; it just prints our message and returns. This means that, when we put the coroutine on the event loop, it will execute immediately because we don’t have any blocking I/O, and nothing is pausing execution yet. This syntax is simple, but we’re creating something very different from a plain Python function. To illustrate this, let’s create a function that adds one to an integer as well as a coroutine that does the same and compare the results of calling each. We’ll also use the type convenience function to look at the type returned by calling a corou tine as compared to calling our normal function.\ndef add_function(a,b): return a+b async def add_coroutine(a,b): return a+b function=add_function(1,2) coroutine=add_coroutine(1,2) print(type(function)) print(type(coroutine)) When we run this code, we’ll see output like the following\nMethod result is 3 and the type is \u0026lt;class \u0026#39;int\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\rCoroutine result is \u0026lt;coroutine object coroutine_add_one at 0x1071d6040\u0026gt; and the type is \u0026lt;class \u0026#39;coroutine\u0026#39;\u0026gt; Notice how when we call our normal add_one function it executes immediately and returns what we would expect, another integer. However, when we call coroutine_ add_one we don’t get our code in the coroutine executed at all. We get a coroutine object instead. This is an important point, as coroutines aren’t executed when we call them directly. Instead, we create a coroutine object that can be run later. To run a corou tine, we need to explicitly run it on an event loop. So how can we create an event loop and run our coroutine?\nIn versions of Python older than 3.7, we had to create an event loop if one did not already exist. However, the asyncio library has added several functions that abstract the event loop management. There is a convenience function, asyncio.run, we can use to run our coroutine. This is illustrated in the following listing.\nimport asyncio async def add_coroutine(a,b): return a+b res=asyncio.run(add_coroutine(1,2)) print(res) When we run this code, we’ll see output like the following:\n3 We’ve properly put our coroutine on the event loop, and we have executed it! asyncio.run is doing a few important things in this scenario. First, it creates a brand-new event. Once it successfully does so, it takes whichever coroutine we pass into it and runs it until it completes, returning the result. This function will also do some cleanup of anything that might be left running after the main coroutine fin ishes. Once everything has finished, it shuts down and closes the event loop. Possibly the most important thing about asyncio.run is that it is intended to be the main entry point into the asyncio application we have created. It only executes one coroutine, and that coroutine should launch all other aspects of our application. As we progress further, we will use this function as the entry point into nearly all our applications. The coroutine that asyncio.run executes will create and run other coroutines that will allow us to utilize the concurrent nature of asyncio.\n2.3 Pausing execution with the await keyword The example we saw in block 2.2 did not need to be a coroutine, as it executed only non-blocking Python code. The real benefit of asyncio is being able to pause execu tion to let the event loop run other tasks during a long-running operation. To pause execution, we use the await keyword. The await keyword is usually followed by a call to a coroutine (more specifically, an object known as an awaitable, which is not always a coroutine; we’ll learn more about awaitables later in the chapter). Using the await keyword will cause the coroutine following it to be run, unlike calling a coroutine directly, which produces a coroutine object. The await expression will also pause the coroutine where it is contained in until the coroutine we awaited finishes and returns a result. When the coroutine we awaited finishes, we’ll have access to the result it returned, and the containing coroutine will “wake up” to handle the result. We can use the await keyword by putting it in front of a coroutine call. Expanding on our earlier program, we can write a program where we call the add_coroutine function inside of a “main” async function and get the result\nimport asyncio async def add_one(number: int) -\u0026gt; int: return number + 1 async def main() -\u0026gt; None: one_plus_one = await add_one(1) # Pause, and wait for the result of add_one(1). two_plus_one = await add_one(2) # Pause, and wait for the result of add_one(2). print(one_plus_one) print(two_plus_one) asyncio.run(main()) Note: Coroutine will only run when we use await keyword. If we call the coroutine directly it will return a coroutine object.\nIn above code we pause execution twice. We first await the call to add_one(1). Once we have the result, the main function will be “unpaused,” and we will assign the return value from add_one(1) to the variable one_plus_one, which in this case will be two. We then do the same for add_one(2) and then print the results.We can visualize the execution flow of our application, as shown in figure\nAs it stands now, this code does not operate differently from normal, sequential code. We are, in effect, mimicking a normal call stack. Next, let’s look at a simple example of how to run other code by introducing a dummy sleep operation while we’re waiting.\n2.4 Introducing long-running coroutines with sleep Our previous examples did not use any slow operations and were used to help us learn the basic syntax of coroutines. To fully see the benefits and show how we can run mul tiple events simultaneously, we’ll need to introduce some long-running operations. Instead of making web API or database queries right away, which are nondeterministic as to how much time they will take, we’ll simulate long-running operations by specify ing how long we want to wait. We’ll do this with the asyncio.sleep function. We can use asyncio.sleep to make a coroutine “sleep” for a given number of sec onds. This will pause our coroutine for the time we give it, simulating what would hap pen if we had a long-running call to a database or web API. asyncio.sleep is itself a coroutine, so we must use it with the await keyword. If we call it just by itself, we’ll get a coroutine object. Since asyncio.sleep is a coroutine, this means that when a coroutine awaits it, other code will be able to run. Let’s examine a simple example, shown in the following listing, that sleeps for 1 sec ond and then prints a \u0026lsquo;Hello World!\u0026rsquo; message.\nimport asyncio async def hello_world_message(): await asyncio.sleep(1) print(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;) asyncio.run(hello_world_message()) When we run this application, our program will wait 1 second before printing our \u0026lsquo;Hello World!\u0026rsquo; message. Since hello_world_message is a coroutine and we pause it for 1 second with asyncio.sleep, we now have 1 second where we could be running other code concurrently.\nWe’ll be using sleep a lot in the next few examples, so let’s invest the time to cre ate a reusable coroutine that sleeps for us and prints out some useful information. We’ll call this coroutine delay. This is shown in the following listing\nimport asyncio async def delay(delaysecond): print(f\u0026#39;Sleeping for delay seconds : {delaysecond}\u0026#39;) await asyncio.sleep(delaysecond) print(f\u0026#39;finished sleeping for {delay_seconds} second(s)\u0026#39;) return delay_seconds delay will take in an integer of the duration in seconds that we’d like the function to sleep and will return that integer to the caller once it has finished sleeping. We’ll also print when sleep begins and ends. This will help us see what other code, if any, is run ning concurrently while our coroutines are paused.\nTo make referencing this utility function easier in future code listings, we’ll create a module that we’ll import in the remainder of this book when needed. We’ll also add to this module as we create additional reusable functions. We’ll call this module util, and we’ll put our delay function in a file called delay_functions.py. We’ll also add an init.py file with the following line, so we can nicely import the timer\nfrom util.delay_functions import delay From now on in this book, we’ll use from util import delay whenever we need to use the delay function. Now that we have a reusable delay coroutine, let’s combine it with the earlier coroutine add_one to see if we can get our simple addition to run concur rently while hello_world_message is paused.\nimport asyncio from util.delay_functions import delay async def add_one(number): return number + 1 async def hello_world_message(): await delay(1) print(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;) async def main() -\u0026gt; None: message = await hello_world_message() #pause until hello_world_message is finished one_plus_one = await add_one(1) #pause until add_one is finished print(one_plus_one) print(message) asyncio.run(main()) When we run this, 1 second passes before the results of both function calls are printed. What we really want is the value of add_one(1) to be printed immediately while hello_world_message()runs concurrently. So why isn’t this happening with this code? The answer is that await pauses our current coroutine and won’t execute any other code inside that coroutine until the await expression gives us a value. Since it will take 1 second for our hello_world_message function to give us a value, the main coroutine will be paused for 1 second. Our code behaves as if it were sequential in this case. This behavior is illustrated in figure\nWe can see that the main coroutine is paused for 1 second while hello_world_\nBoth main and hello_world paused while we wait for delay(1) to finish. After it has finished, main resumes and can execute add_one. We’d like to move away from this sequential model and run add_one concurrently with hello_world. To achieve this, we’ll need to introduce a concept called tasks.\n2.5 Running concurrently with task In Python\u0026rsquo;s asyncio, you can create tasks to run code concurrently. This is done using the asyncio.create_task function. When you create a task, it starts running in the background immediately, allowing your program to do other things while waiting for the task to finish.\nKey Points: Creating a Task:\nUse asyncio.create_task() with a coroutine function as its input. It returns a task object instantly. Awaiting a Task:\nYou can use await with the task object to pause your program until the task is done and get its result. Why Use Tasks?\nTasks allow other parts of your program to run without waiting for one operation to finish. Code Example: Creating and Using a Task import asyncio from util import delay # A custom function that simulates a delay async def main(): # Create a task that takes 3 seconds to complete sleep_for_three = asyncio.create_task(delay(3)) # Immediately print the type of the task object print(f\u0026#34;Task type: {type(sleep_for_three)}\u0026#34;) # Wait for the task to finish and get the result result = await sleep_for_three print(f\u0026#34;Task result: {result}\u0026#34;) # Run the main coroutine asyncio.run(main()) What’s Happening in the Code: Task Creation:\nasyncio.create_task(delay(3)) creates a task to run the delay(3) coroutine in the background. The task is of type \u0026lt;class '_asyncio.Task'\u0026gt;, which is different from a regular coroutine. Running Concurrently:\nAfter creating the task, the program does not wait for the task to finish. The print() statement runs immediately after the task is created. Waiting for the Task:\nThe await sleep_for_three line pauses the main coroutine until the task finishes. Once the task is complete, it returns its result, which is printed. Why Await is Important: If you don’t use await on a task, it might not get enough time to finish. When the asyncio.run function exits, the event loop stops, and any unfinished tasks are “cleaned up” without completing. Using await ensures the task has a chance to finish.\nNote : When we create task using asyncio.create_task it run the task immediately in the background. It does not wait for the task to finish and immediately return a task object such that our program can do other things while waiting for the task to finish.We can use await later on to pause the program until the task is done and get its result.\n2.6 Running multiple tasks concurrently Given that tasks are created instantly and are scheduled to run as soon as possible, this allows us to run many long-running tasks concurrently. We can do this by sequentially starting multiple tasks with our long-running coroutine.\nimport asyncio from util.delay_functions import delay async def main(): # Create two tasks that take 3 seconds to complete sleep_for_three=asyncio.create_task(delay(3)) sleep_again=asyncio.create_task(delay(3)) sleep_once_more=asyncio.create_task(delay(3)) await sleep_for_three await sleep_again await sleep_once_more asyncio.run(main()) In this code, we create three tasks that each sleep for 3 seconds. We then await each task in sequence. This will cause each task to run concurrently, and the total time to complete will be around 3 seconds, not 9 seconds. This is because we are not waiting for each task to finish before starting the next one. Lets breakdown\nStarting Three Tasks:\nThe program begins by creating three tasks, each of which takes 3 seconds to complete. The create_task function starts the tasks immediately but doesn\u0026rsquo;t wait for them to finish—it just sets them up to run in the background. The First Await Statement:\nWhen the code reaches the await sleep_for_three line, it pauses and gives control to the event loop. This pause allows the event loop to check for any tasks waiting to run and starts them “as soon as possible.” Tasks Run Simultaneously:\nAll three tasks begin running their sleep operations at the same time because the event loop handles them concurrently. This concurrency allows the program to complete the work in 3 seconds instead of 9. Concurrency in Action:\nWhile the sleep operations run concurrently, any other code in the tasks (like print statements) runs one at a time, not simultaneously. This means only the parts of the tasks that involve waiting (like sleeping) are parallelized. Time Saved:\nIf the tasks were executed one after another, the program would take 9 seconds (3 seconds × 3 tasks). By running the tasks concurrently, the program finishes in just 3 seconds, saving a lot of time. This is illustrated in figure NOTE This benefit compounds as we add more tasks; if we had launched 10 of these tasks, we would still take roughly 3 seconds, giving us a 10-fold speedup. This is the power of concurrency in asyncio.\nasyncio.gather function Gather function is a quick way to run multiple tasks concurrently and wait for all of them to complete. It takes in an iterable of awaitables and returns a single awaitable that will yield results in the order they were created. This is useful when we want to run multiple tasks concurrently and wait for all of them to finish before proceeding.\nimport asyncio from util.delay_functions import delay async def main(): # Create three tasks that take 3 seconds to complete and handel using asyncio.gather results = await asyncio.gather( delay(3), delay(3), delay(3) ) print(results) asyncio.run(main()) Note : For understanding You can use this logic . There is a task queue and event loop. When we only await coroutine there is only one task in the task queue and event loop .\ncoroutine need to await for running the task i.e keep in the task queue and eventloop if we directly run coroutine it will just give us coroutine object.\nWhen we use asyncio.createtask() there are as much task in the task queue as the number of tasks created and event loop will run all the tasks concurrently also when we await new coroutine it will be added to the task queue and event loop will run it concurrently.\nIt return a task object instantly and run all the task concurrently i.e keep in the task queue and event loop without awaiting but does not wait for the task to finish it need to be awaited to get the proper result.\nWhen we use asyncio.gather() it will run all the tasks concurrently and wait for all of them to finish before proceeding.\nIt need to be awaited to keep all the task in the task queue and event loop and wait for all of them to finish before proceeding.After finishing all the task it will return the result in the order they were created and jump to the next line of code of the main coroutine.\n3. Synchronization Premitives Locks Semaphores 3.1 Locks Locks are a synchronization primitive that allows us to limit access to a shared resource to only one coroutine at a time. This is useful when we have a resource that can only be accessed by one coroutine at a time, like a file or a database connection. Locks are created using the asyncio.Lock class and can be acquired using the acquire method and released using the release method.\n#basic example of lock\nimport asyncio async def locking(lock): print(\u0026#39;Waiting for the lock\u0026#39;) async with lock: print(\u0026#39;Acquired the lock\u0026#39;) await asyncio.sleep(2) print(\u0026#39;Released the lock\u0026#39;) async def main(): lock = asyncio.Lock() await asyncio.gather( locking(lock), locking(lock), locking(lock) ) asyncio.run(main()) Output:\nWaiting for the lock\rAcquired the lock\rWaiting for the lock\rWaiting for the lock\rReleased the lock\rAcquired the lock\rReleased the lock\rAcquired the lock\rReleased the lock In this example, we create a lock using asyncio.Lock and pass it to the locking coroutine. We then use the async with statement to acquire the lock and release it when we are done. When we run the program, we can see that only one coroutine can acquire the lock at a time, and the other coroutines have to wait until the lock is released.\n3.2 Semaphores Semaphores are a synchronization primitive that allows us to limit access to a shared resource to a fixed number of coroutines at a time. This is useful when we have a resource that can be accessed by a limited number of coroutines, like a connection pool or a web API. Semaphores are created using the asyncio.Semaphore class and can be acquired using the acquire method and released using the release method.\n#basic example of semaphore\nimport asyncio async def semaphoring(semaphore): async with semaphore: print(\u0026#39;Acquired the semaphore\u0026#39;) await asyncio.sleep(2) print(\u0026#39;Released the semaphore\u0026#39;) async def main(): semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(2) await asyncio.gather( semaphoring(semaphore), semaphoring(semaphore), semaphoring(semaphore), semaphoring(semaphore) ) asyncio.run(main()) Output:\nAcquired the semaphore\rAcquired the semaphore\rAcquired the semaphore\rReleased the semaphore\rReleased the semaphore\rReleased the semaphore\rAcquired the semaphore\rReleased the semaphore In this example, we create a semaphore with a limit of 2 using asyncio.Semaphore and pass it to the semaphoring coroutine. We then use the async with statement to acquire the semaphore and release it when we are done. When we run the program, we can see that only two coroutines can acquire the semaphore at a time, and the other coroutines have to wait until the semaphore is released.\nSome popular asyncio libraries aiohttp: An HTTP client and server library for asyncio. fastapi: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. aiofiles: A file operations library for asyncio.

Some Important Concepts 1.1 Parallism vs Concurrency Parallism: Running multiple tasks at the same time. There are multiple Threads or Processes running at the same time. Concurrency: Switching between multiple tasks. When one task is waiting for I/O, another task can run. There is only one Thread or Process running at a time. 1.2 Synchronous vs Asynchronous Synchronous: Code is executed in sequence. Previous task/line must be completed before the next task/line execution starts. Asynchronous: Code is executed in parallel. Tasks can run concurrently. The next task can start before the previous task is completed. 1.3 Blocking vs Non-Blocking Blocking: The execution of the code is blocked until the task is completed. The next task can\u0026rsquo;t start until the previous task is completed. import time def task1(): print(\u0026#34;Task 1 started\u0026#34;) time.sleep(2) print(\u0026#34;Task 1 completed\u0026#34;) def task2(): print(\u0026#34;Task 2 started\u0026#34;) time.sleep(2) print(\u0026#34;Task 2 completed\u0026#34;) task1() task2() Non-Blocking: The excecution of the code is not blocked. The next task can start before the previous task is completed. import asyncio async def task1(): print(\u0026#34;Task 1 started\u0026#34;) await asyncio.sleep(2) print(\u0026#34;Task 1 completed\u0026#34;) async def task2(): print(\u0026#34;Task 2 started\u0026#34;) await asyncio.sleep(2) print(\u0026#34;Task 2 completed\u0026#34;) async def main(): await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2()) asyncio.run(main()) 1.4 I/O Bound vs CPU Bound I/O Bound: The program is waiting for input/output operations to complete. The program is not using the CPU much. CPU Bound: The program is using the CPU a lot. The program is not waiting for input/output operations to complete. import request response = request.get(\u0026#34;https://www.google.com\u0026#34;) # I/O Bound items = response.headers.items() # CPU Bound headers = [f\u0026#39;{key}: {header}\u0026#39; for key, header in items] # CPU Bound formatted_headers = \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;.join(headers) # CPU Bound with open(\u0026#39;headers.txt\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;w\u0026#39;) as file: # I/O Bound file.write(formatted_headers) # I/O Bound 2. How Concurrency is Achieved in Os level To better understand this, we’ll need to dive into how sockets work and, in particular, how non-blocking sockets work.\n2.1 Sockets A socket is a low-level abstraction for sending and receiving data over a network. It is the basis for how data is transferred to and from servers. Sockets support two main operations: sending bytes and receiving bytes. We write bytes to a socket, which will then get sent to a remote address, typically some type of server. Once we’ve sent those bytes, we wait for the server to write its response back to our socket. Once these bytes have been sent back to our socket, we can then read the result.\nIn the case of getting the contents from example.com as we saw earlier, we open a socket that connects to example.com’s server. We then write a request to get the contents to that socket and wait for the server to reply with the result: in this case, the HTML of the web page. We can visualize the flow of bytes to and from the server in figure 1.7\nSockets are blocking by default. Simply put, this means that when we are waiting for a server to reply with data, we halt our application or block it until we get data to read. Thus, our application stops running any other tasks until we get data from the server, an error happens, or there is a timeout. At the operating system level, we don’t need to do this blocking. Sockets can operate in non-blocking mode. In non-blocking mode, when we write bytes to a socket, we can just fire and forget the write or read, and our application can go on to perform other tasks. Later, we can have the operating system tell us that we received bytes and deal with it at that time. This lets the application do any number of things while we wait for bytes to come back to us. Instead of blocking and waiting for data to come to us, we become more reactive, letting the operating system inform us when there is data for us to act on. In the background, this is performed by a few different event notification systems, depending on which operating system we’re running. asyncio is abstracted enough that it switches between the different notification systems, depending on which one our operating system supports. The following are the event notification systems used by specific operating systems:\nkqueue—FreeBSD and MacOS epoll—Linux IOCP (I/O completion port)—Windows These systems keep track of our non-blocking sockets and notify us when they are ready for us to do something with them. This notification system is the basis of how asyncio can achieve concurrency.\nBut how do we keep track of multiple tasks that are waiting for data to come back to them? This is where the event loop comes in.\n2.2 Event Loop The event loop is the core of every asyncio application. In asyncio, the event loop keeps a queue of tasks.\n2.2.1 How the Event Loop Works The event loop works by keeping a queue of tasks instead of messages. Each task is a coroutine. When a task is added to the event loop, it will execute until it encounters an I/O operation (such as a web request). When a task hits an I/O-bound operation, it pauses and allows the event loop to run other tasks that are not waiting for I/O operations to complete. 2.2.2 Understanding Event Loops in Asynchronous Programming When working with event loops in asynchronous programming, the process can be understood as a sequence of steps that efficiently handle tasks without blocking the execution. Here\u0026rsquo;s a breakdown of how it works:\n2.2.2.1 Creating the Event Loop When an event loop is created, an empty queue of tasks is initialized. This queue will hold all the tasks that need to be executed.\n2.2.2.2 Adding Tasks to the Queue We add tasks to the event loop’s queue. These tasks are executed one at a time, based on their order in the queue.\n2.2.2.3 Processing Tasks Iteratively Each iteration of the event loop checks for tasks that need to be executed. It processes tasks sequentially, running them one by one.\n2.2.2.4 Handling I/O Operations If a task encounters an I/O operation (like reading from a file or making a network request), it cannot proceed immediately. In this case, the task is paused and put on hold.\n2.2.2.5 Pausing and Waiting for I/O Completion When a task is paused, the event loop instructs the operating system to monitor any associated sockets or resources for I/O completion. During this time, the event loop continues checking for and executing other tasks.\n2.2.2.6 Waking Up Paused Tasks On each iteration of the event loop, we check if any of the I/O operations have completed. If they have:\nThe paused task is woken up. The task resumes execution and completes its process. 2.2.2.7. Conclusion This cycle of pausing, waiting for I/O, and resuming tasks allows the event loop to run multiple tasks concurrently, making it an efficient way to handle asynchronous operations without blocking the program.\nBy continuously iterating and checking for completed I/O tasks, the event loop ensures that no task is left idle while waiting for I/O operations, enabling a smooth and efficient workflow.\nVisualizing the Event Loop with Asynchronous Tasks We can visualize how the event loop works with asynchronous tasks as shown in Figure 1.9: the main thread submits tasks to the event loop, which then runs them. When a task encounters an I/O operation, it pauses and allows other tasks to run. Once the I/O operation is complete, the paused task is resumed.\nExample: Submitting Multiple Asynchronous Tasks Let\u0026rsquo;s consider three tasks that each make an asynchronous web request. These tasks consist of:\nCPU-bound setup: Some code that prepares data for the web request. I/O-bound web request: The asynchronous part where we send the web request. CPU-bound post-processing: After the web request completes, we do some more CPU-intensive work. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s submit these tasks to the event loop simultaneously. Here’s how we can write this in pseudocode:\ndef make_request(): cpu_bound_setup() io_bound_web_request() cpu_bound_postprocess() task_one = make_request() task_two = make_request() task_three = make_request() First task starts executing code, and the other two are left waiting to run. Once the CPU-bound setup work is finished in Task 1, it hits an I/O-bound operation and will pause itself to say, “I’m waiting for I/O; any other tasks waiting to run can run.” Once this happens, Task 2 can begin executing. Task 2 starts its CPU-bound code and then pauses, waiting for I/O. At this time both Task 1 and Task 2 are waiting concurrently for their network request to complete. Since Tasks 1 and 2 are both paused waiting for I/O, we start running Task 3. Now imagine once Task 3 pauses to wait for its I/O to complete, the web request for Task 1 has finished. We’re now alerted by our operating system’s event notification system that this I/O has finished. We can now resume executing Task 1 while both Task 2 and Task 3 are waiting for their I/O to finish. In figure 1.10, we show the execution flow of the pseudocode we just described. If we look at any vertical slice of this diagram, we can see that only one CPU-bound piece of work is running at any given time; however, we have up to two I/O-bound operations happening concurrently. This overlapping of waiting for I/O per each task is where the real time savings of asyncio comes in.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/asyncio/asyncio1/","summary":"An introduction to asynchronous programming in Python using asyncio.","title":"Async io : Async io Intro (Day 1)"},{"content":"Python Fundamentals: A Beginner\u0026rsquo;s Guide (Part 1) 1.

Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can create a virtual environment named myenv:\npython -m venv myenv This command creates a new directory named myenv that contains the necessary files for the virtual environment.\n1.3. Activating a Virtual Environment To activate the virtual environment, you may run the following command:\n# For Linux/Mac: source myenv/bin/activate # For Windows: myenv\\Scripts\\activate 2. Python Packages 2.1. List All the Python Packages To list or save all the installed packages in the current environment, you can use the following command using freeze:\npip freeze # To list all the installed packages pip freeze \u0026gt; requirements.txt # To save all the installed packages in a file 2.2. Installing Python Packages To install a Python package, you can use the pip install command followed by the package name. For example, to install the requests package, you can run:\npip install requests 2.3. Uninstalling Python Packages To uninstall a Python package, you can use the pip uninstall command followed by the package name. For example, to uninstall the requests package, you can run:\npip uninstall requests 2.4. Run Python Package/Script To run a python package or script, you can use the following command:\npython -m package_name 3. Python Basics 3.1. Running a Python Script To run a Python script, you can use the following command:\npython script.py 3.2. Python Indentation In Python, the code block (body of the function, loop, etc.) starts with a colon (:) and the line following the colon should be indented.\nif 5 \u0026gt; 2: print(\u0026#34;Five is greater than two!\u0026#34;) # Indented block 3.3. Python Comments There are two types of comments in Python:\n# This is a single line comment \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; This is a multiline comment This is a multiline comment This is a multiline comment This is a multiline comment \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; 3.4. Print Statement The print() function is used to display the output on the console. For example:\nprint(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;) 3.5. Data Types Python has the following data types:\nint float str bool list tuple set dict None a = 10 # int b = 10.5 # float c = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; # str d = True # bool e = [1,2,3] # list f = (1,2,3) # tuple g = {1,2,3} # set h = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;:30} # dict i = None # None print(type(a)) # \u0026lt;class \u0026#39;int\u0026#39;\u0026gt; Note:Use type() function to check the data type of a variable.As it return the class of the variable.\n3.6. Rules of Variable Declaration A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character. A variable name cannot start with a number. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ). Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are three different variables). 3.7. Type Conversion You can convert one data type to another using the following functions:\nint(): To convert to an integer float(): To convert to a float str(): To convert to a string bool(): To convert to a boolean list(): To convert to a list tuple(): To convert to a tuple set(): To convert to a set dict(): To convert to a dictionary a = 10 #a=10 b = float(a) #b=10.0 c = str(a) #c=\u0026#39;10\u0026#39; d = bool(a) #d=True e = list(c) #e=[\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;0\u0026#39;] f = tuple(c) #f=(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;0\u0026#39;) g = set(c) #g={\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;0\u0026#39;} h = dict(name=\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;,age=30) or dict([(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;),(\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;,30)]) #h={\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;John\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;age\u0026#39;:30} Note: Python is dynamically typed, which means a variable\u0026rsquo;s data type can be changed.\n4. Operators 4.1. Arithmetic Operators +: Addition -: Subtraction *: Multiplication /: Division %: Modulus **: Power //: Floor Division a = 10 b = 3 print(a + b) # 13 print(a - b) # 7 print(a * b) # 30 print(a / b) # 3.3333333333333335 print(a % b) # 1 print(a ** b) # 1000 print(a // b) # 3 4.2. Assignment Operators =: Assign value +=: Add and assign -=: Subtract and assign *=: Multiply and assign /=: Divide and assign %=: Modulus and assign **=: Power and assign //=: Floor Division and assign a = 10 a += 5 # a = a + 5 a -= 5 # a = a - 5 a *= 5 # a = a * 5 a /= 5 # a = a / 5 a %= 5 # a = a % 5 a **= 5 # a = a ** 5 a //= 5 # a = a // 5 4.3.

Logical Operators and: Returns True if both statements are true or: Returns True if one of the statements is true not: Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true a = 10 b = 20 c = 30 print(a \u0026lt; b and b \u0026lt; c) # True print(a \u0026lt; b or b \u0026gt; c) # True print(not(a \u0026lt; b and b \u0026lt; c)) # False 4.5. Identity Operators is: Returns True if both variables are the same object is not: Returns True if both variables are not the same object a = [1,2,3] b = [1,2,3] print(a is b) # False print(a is not b) # True 4.6. Membership Operators in: Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object not in: Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object a = [1,2,3] #Can be used in list , tuple , set , dict, string print(1 in a) # True print(4 not in a) # True 4.7.

Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\nname = input(\u0026#34;Enter your name: \u0026#34;) print(\u0026#34;Hello, \u0026#34; + name) Note: The input() function always returns a string. If you want to convert it to another data type, you can use type conversion functions like int(), float(), etc.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/python/python_basics/","summary":"A comprehensive guide to Python programming fundamentals covering core concepts for beginners","title":"Python Fundamentals: A Beginner's Guide (Part 1)"},{"content":"1. Python Manupulation of Data Types We have already discussed the basic concepts of Python programming in the previous part of this series. In this part, we will dive deeper into operations and manipulations of different data types in Python.\n1.1.Numeric Operations 1.1.1. abs() Function The abs() function returns the absolute value of a number. For example:\nnum = -10 print(abs(num)) # Output: 10 1.1.2. round() Function The round() function rounds a number to the nearest integer. For example:\nnum = 3.14159 print(round(num)) # Output: 3 1.1.3. ord() Function The ord() function returns the Unicode code point of a character. For example:\nchar = \u0026#39;A\u0026#39; print(ord(char)) # Output: 65 1.2. String Operations String is a sequence of characters enclosed within single, double, or triple quotes. In Python, strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created. Here are some common string operations:\n1.2.1. Declaring a String we can declare a string using single, double, or triple quotes. For example:\nstr1 = \u0026#39;Hello, World!\u0026#39; #for single line string str2 = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; #for single line string str3 = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;Hello, World! This is a multiline string.\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;#for multiline string 1.2.2. Text Decorators There are many text decorators available in Python to format strings among them we use \\n for a new line, \\t for a tab. For example:\nstr1 = \u0026#39;Hello, \\nWorld!\u0026#39; #for new line str2 = \u0026#34;Hello, \\tWorld!\u0026#34; #for tab 1.2.3. String Indexing The indexing of a string starts from 0 to n-1, where n is the length of the string. For example: for example: a=\u0026ldquo;hello\u0026rdquo;\na = H e l l o 0 1 2 3 4 0 -4 -3 -2 -1 1.2.4. Ascessing Characters in a String We can access characters in a string using the index using []. For example:\nstr = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(str[0]) # Output: H print(str[-1]) # Output: ! 1.2.5. String Concatenation We can concatenate two strings using the + operator and * operator . For example:\nstr1 = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; str2 = \u0026#34;World\u0026#34; print(str1 + str2) # Output: HelloWorld print(str1 * 3) # Output: HelloHelloHello 1.2.6. String Slicing We can slice a string using the syntax variable[start:end:step] to get a substring.\nNote: The substring contains characters from index start to end-1, meaning the character at the end index is not included but character at the start index is included . The step refers to the increment or jump of the index\nFor example:\na = \u0026#34;hello\u0026#34; # Slice from index 1 to the end of the string print(a[1:]) # ello (Characters from index 1 to the end) # Slice from the beginning of the string to index 4 (doesn\u0026#39;t contain character at index 4) print(a[:4]) # hell (Characters from index 0 to 3) # Slice from index 1 to index 4 (doesn\u0026#39;t contain character at index 4) print(a[1:4]) # ell (Characters from index 1 to 3) # Full slice of the string with default values print(a[::]) # hello (Default start is 0, end is the string length, step is 1) # Defining a step value in slicing # Slice with a step of 2 print(a[::2]) # hlo (Start from index 0 to the end, select every 2nd character) # Reverse the string using a negative step print(a[::-1]) # olleh (Reverse the string by stepping backward) # Combining start, end, and step print(a[1:4:2]) # el #(Start from index 1 to 4 (doesn\u0026#39;t contain character at index 4), with a step of 2) 1.2.7. String Methods Python provides various built-in methods to manipulate strings. Some of the commonly used string methods are:\nlen() : Returns the length of the string. str = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(len(str)) # Output: 13 replace() : Replaces a substring with another substring. str = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(str.replace(\u0026#34;World\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Universe\u0026#34;)) # Output: Hello, Universe! upper() : Converts the string to uppercase. str = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(str.upper()) # Output: HELLO, WORLD! lower() : Converts the string to lowercase. str = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(str.lower()) # Output: hello, world! split() : Splits the string into a list based on the delimiter. str = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(str.split(\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;)) # Output: [\u0026#39;Hello\u0026#39;, \u0026#39; World!\u0026#39;] capitalize() : Converts the first character of the string to uppercase.\nstr = \u0026#34;hello, world!\u0026#34; print(str.capitalize()) # Output: Hello, world! -find() : Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring.\nstr = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(str.find(\u0026#34;World\u0026#34;)) # Output: 7 print(str.find(\u0026#34;e\u0026#34;)) # Output: 1 print(str.find(\u0026#34;Universe\u0026#34;)) # Output: -1 count() : Returns the number of occurrences of a substring. str = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(str.count(\u0026#34;l\u0026#34;)) # Output: 3 startswith() : Returns True if the string starts with a specified substring. str = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(str.startswith(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;)) # Output: True endswith() : Returns True if the string ends with a specified substring. str = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(str.endswith(\u0026#34;World!\u0026#34;)) # Output: True strip() : Removes leading and trailing whitespaces from the string. We can also specify the characters to be removed. str = \u0026#34; Hello, World! \u0026#34; print(str.strip()) # Output: Hello, World! str = \u0026#34;!!!!!!!!Hello, World!!!!!\u0026#34; print(str.strip(\u0026#34;!\u0026#34;)) # Output: Hello, World! lstrip() : Removes leading whitespaces from the string.we can also specify the characters to be removed. str = \u0026#34; Hello, World! \u0026#34; print(str.lstrip()) # Output: Hello, World! str = \u0026#34;!!!!!!!!Hello, World!!!!!\u0026#34; print(str.lstrip(\u0026#34;!\u0026#34;)) # Output: Hello, World!!!!! rstrip() : Removes trailing whitespaces from the string.We can also specify the characters to be removed. str = \u0026#34; Hello, World! \u0026#34; print(str.rstrip()) # Output: Hello, World! str = \u0026#34;!!!!!!!!Hello, World!!!!!\u0026#34; print(str.rstrip(\u0026#34;!\u0026#34;)) # Output: !!!!!!!!Hello, World 1.2.8. f-Strings f-strings are a convenient way to format strings in Python. They allow you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}. For example:\nname = \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34; age = 30 print(f\u0026#34;My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\u0026#34;) # Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old. 1.2.9. Raw Strings Raw strings are used to ignore escape characters in a string. They are prefixed with an r or R. For example:\npath=\u0026#34;C:\\Users\\Alice\\Documents\u0026#34; print(path) # Output: C:UsersAliceDocuments path = r\u0026#34;C:\\Users\\Alice\\Documents\u0026#34; print(path) # Output: C:\\Users\\Alice\\Documents Note:String is immutable in python.\na = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; a[0] = \u0026#34;h\u0026#34; # Error: \u0026#39;str\u0026#39; object does not support item assignment #Instead To change the string value we can use the following method a=\u0026#39;k\u0026#39;+a[1::] # Output: \u0026#39;kello\u0026#39; 1.3. List Operations A list is a collection of items enclosed within square brackets []. Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after creation. Here are some common list operations: Key Points:\nList is mutable in python. List support indexing and slicing like string 1.3.1. Declaring a List We can declare a list by enclosing items within square brackets []. For example:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] list2 = [\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cherry\u0026#34;] list3 = [1, \u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, True, 3.14] 1.3.2 List Concatenation We can concatenate two or more lists using the + operator. For example:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3] list2 = [4, 5, 6] print(list1 + list2) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 1.3.3. Mutable property of List List is mutable in python and its example is shown below:\n#for string a = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; a[0] = \u0026#34;h\u0026#34; # Error: \u0026#39;str\u0026#39; object does not support item assignment #for list list1 = [1, 2, 3] list1[0] = 10 print(list1) # Output: [10, 2, 3] 1.3.4. Built-in List Methods Python provides various built-in methods to manipulate lists. Some of the commonly used list methods are:\nlen() : Returns the length of the list. list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(len(list1)) # Output: 5 append() : Adds an element to the end of the list /Change orginal list does not return anything. list1 = [1, 2, 3] list1.append(4) print(list1) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] insert() : Inserts an element at a specified position in the list /Change orginal list does not return anything. list1 = [1, 2, 3] list1.insert(1, 4) print(list1) # Output: [1, 4, 2, 3] pop() : Removes the element at the specified position in the list and returns it. If no index is specified, it removes and returns the last element. list1 = [1, 2, 3] print(list1.pop(1)) # Output: 2 print(list1) # Output: [1, 3] print(list1.pop()) # Output: 3 print(list1) # Output: [1] remove() : Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the list. list1 = [1, 2, 3, 2] list1.remove(2) print(list1) # Output: [1, 3, 2] -sort() : Sorts the list in ascending order.Does not return anything but change the original list.\nlist1 = [3, 1, 2] list1.sort() print(list1) # Output: [1, 2, 3] -reverse() : Reverses the order of the list. Does not return anything but change the original list.\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3] list1.reverse() print(list1) # Output: [3, 2, 1] -count() : Returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in the list.\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 2] print(list1.count(2)) # Output: 2 -index() : Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in the list.\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 2] print(list1.index(2)) # Output: 1 1.3.5. List Comprehension List comprehension is a concise way to create lists from existing lists. There are 3 type of syntax.\nNot using if list1=[variable for variable in iterable] Using if only list1 = [variable for variable in iterable if condition] Using if else list1 = [variable if condition else variable for variable in iterable] Traditional way of creating list\nlist1 = [] for i in range(5): list1.append(i) print(list1) # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] Using list comprehension\nlist1 = [i for i in range(5)] print(list1) # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] list1 = [i for i in range(5) if i%2==0] print(list1) # Output: [0, 2, 4] list1 = [i if i%2==0 else i**2 for i in range(5)] print(list1) # Output: [0, 1, 2, 9, 4] Note: When you attempt to access an index that is out of range, Python will raise an IndexError so put it in try-except block to handle the error.\nNote: The indexing and slicing of list are similar to string.\n1.4 Dictionary Operations A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces {}. Dictionaries are mutable and unordered. Here are some common dictionary operations:\n1.4.1. Declaring a Dictionary We can declare a dictionary by specifying key-value pairs within curly braces {}. For example:\ndict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;} dict2 = {1: \u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, 2: \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;, 3: \u0026#34;cherry\u0026#34;} dict3 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hobbies\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;reading\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;painting\u0026#34;]} 1.4.2. Accessing Dictionary Elements We can access dictionary elements using keys. For example:\ndict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;} print(dict1[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;]) # Output: Alice 1.4.3 Adding Dictionary Elements We can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary by specifying the key and value. For example:\ndict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30} dict1[\u0026#34;city\u0026#34;] = \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34; print(dict1) # Output: {\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;age\u0026#39;: 30, \u0026#39;city\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;New York\u0026#39;} 1.4.4. Updating Dictionary Elements We can update the value of an existing key in a dictionary. For example:\ndict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;} dict1[\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;] = 35 print(dict1) # Output: {\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;age\u0026#39;: 35, \u0026#39;city\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;New York\u0026#39;} 1.4.5 Dictionary Methods Python provides various built-in methods to manipulate dictionaries. Some of the commonly used dictionary methods are:\nlen() : Returns the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary. dict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;} print(len(dict1)) # Output: 3 keys() : Returns a list of all the keys in the dictionary. dict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;} print(dict1.keys()) # Output: dict_keys([\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;age\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;city\u0026#39;]) values() : Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary. dict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;} print(dict1.values()) # Output: dict_values([\u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, 30, \u0026#39;New York\u0026#39;]) items() : Returns a list of key-value pairs in the dictionary. dict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;} print(dict1.items()) # Output: dict_items([(\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;), (\u0026#39;age\u0026#39;, 30), (\u0026#39;city\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;New York\u0026#39;)]) -pop() : Removes the element with the specified key and returns its value.\ndict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;} print(dict1.pop(\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;)) # Output: 30 print(dict1) # Output: {\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;city\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;New York\u0026#39;} -get() : Returns the value of the specified key. If the key does not exist, it returns the specified default value.\ndict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;} print(dict1.get(\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;)) # Output: 30 print(dict) # Output: {\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;age\u0026#39;: 30, \u0026#39;city\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;New York\u0026#39;} Note: When you attempt to access a key that does not exist in the dictionary, Python will raise a KeyError so put it in try-except block to handle the error or use get() method to avoid the error.\n1.4.6. Nested Dictionaries A dictionary can contain another dictionary as a value. This is known as a nested dictionary. For example:\ndict1 = { \u0026#34;person1\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30}, \u0026#34;person2\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 25} } print(dict1[\u0026#34;person1\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;]) # Output: Alice 1.4.7. Dictionary Comprehension Dictionary comprehension is a concise way to create dictionaries. For example:\ndict1 = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)} # Output: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16} #using if only dict1 = {x: x**2 for x in range(5) if x%2==0} # Output: {0: 0, 2: 4, 4: 16} #using if else dict1 = {x: x**2 if x%2==0 else x**3 for x in range(5)} # Output: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 27, 4: 16} 1.5. Tuple Operations A tuple is a collection of items enclosed within parentheses (). Tuples are immutable, meaning they similar to python as they cant be changed using indexing as a[0]=10 will give an error.\n1.5.1. Declaring a Tuple We can declare a tuple by enclosing items within parentheses (). For example:\ntuple1 = (1, 2, 3) tuple2 = (\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cherry\u0026#34;) tuple3 = (1, \u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, True, 3.14) 1.5.2. Accessing Tuple Elements We can access tuple elements using indexing . For example:\ntuple1 = (1, 2, 3) print(tuple1[0]) # Output: 1 1.5.3. Slice Tuple We can slice a tuple using the syntax variable[start:end:step] to get a sub-tuple. For example:\ntuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) print(tuple1[1:4]) # Output: (2, 3, 4) 1.5.4. Tuple Methods Python provides various built-in methods to manipulate tuples. Some of the commonly used tuple methods are:\ncount() : Returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in the tuple. tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 2) print(tuple1.count(2)) # Output: 2 index() : Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in the tuple. tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 2) print(tuple1.index(2)) # Output: 1 len() : Returns the length of the tuple. tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 2) print(len(tuple1)) # Output: 4 1.5.5 concatenation of tuple We can concatenate two or more tuples using the + operator. For example:\ntuple1 = (1, 2, 3) tuple2 = (4, 5, 6) print(tuple1 + tuple2) # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 1.5.6. Tuple Unpacking Tuple unpacking allows us to assign multiple variables at once. For example:\ntuple1 = (1, 2, 3) a, b, c = tuple1 d,*e = tuple1 print(a) # Output: 1 print(b) # Output: 2 print(c) # Output: 3 print(d) # Output: 1 print(e) # Output: [2, 3] tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) a, *b, c = tuple1 print(a) # Output: 1 print(b) # Output: [2, 3, 4] print(c) # Output: 5 Note:Ascessing and slicing of tuple is similar to list and string.\n1.6. Boolean Operations Boolean is a data type that represents one of two values: True or False. Boolean values are used to evaluate conditions in programming. Here are some common boolean operations:\n1.6.1. Condition when variable is True When a variable has a non-zero value, it is considered True. a = 10 if a: print(\u0026#34;The value of a is True\u0026#34;) When a string is not empty, it is considered True. a = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; if a: print(\u0026#34;The value of a is True\u0026#34;) When a list is not empty, it is considered True. a = [1, 2, 3] if a: print(\u0026#34;The value of a is True\u0026#34;) When a dictionary is not empty, it is considered True. a = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30} if a: print(\u0026#34;The value of a is True\u0026#34;) When a tuple is not empty, it is considered True. a = (1, 2, 3) if a: print(\u0026#34;The value of a is True\u0026#34;) When a set is not empty, it is considered True. a = {1, 2, 3} if a: print(\u0026#34;The value of a is True\u0026#34;) When a variable is explicitly set to True, it is considered True. a = True if a: print(\u0026#34;The value of a is True\u0026#34;) 1.6.2. Condition when variable is False Those which are not in the above condition are considered as False.\n1.7. Set Operations A set is a collection of unique items enclosed within curly braces {}. Main Uses of set are:\nTo remove duplicate elements from a list. To perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, etc. 1.7.1. Declaring a Set We can declare a set by enclosing items within curly braces {} or set(). For example:\nset1 = {1, 2, 3} set2 = {\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cherry\u0026#34;} set3 = {1, \u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, True, 3.14} #using set() set4 = set([1, 2, 3]) set5=set() 1.7.2. Set Methods Python provides various built-in methods to manipulate sets. Some of the commonly used set methods are:\n-len() : Returns the number of elements in the set.\nset1 = {1, 2, 3} print(len(set1)) # Output: 3 -add() : Adds an element to the set.Doesn\u0026rsquo;t return anything.\nset1 = {1, 2, 3} set1.add(4) print(set1) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4} -clear() : Removes all elements from the set.Doesn\u0026rsquo;t return anything.\nset1 = {1, 2, 3} set1.clear() print(set1) # Output: set() -remove() : Removes the specified element from the set. If the element is not present, it raises an error.\nset1 = {1, 2, 3} set1.remove(2) print(set1) # Output: {1, 3} discard() : Removes the specified element from the set. If the element is not present, it does not raise an error.\nset1 = {1, 2, 3} set1.discard(2) print(set1) # Output: {1, 3} -union() : Returns a set containing the union of two sets.\nset1 = {1, 2, 3} set2 = {3, 4, 5} print(set1.union(set2)) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -intersection() : Returns a set containing the intersection of two sets.\nset1 = {1, 2, 3} set2 = {3, 4, 5} print(set1.intersection(set2)) # Output: {3} -difference() : Returns a set containing the difference between two sets.\nset1 = {1, 2, 3} set2 = {3, 4, 5} print(set1.difference(set2)) # Output: {1, 2} -symmetric_difference() : Returns a set containing the symmetric difference between two sets.\nset1 = {1, 2, 3} set2 = {3, 4, 5} print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2)) # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5} -issubset() : Returns True if all elements of a set are present in another set.\nset1 = {1, 2, 3} set2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} print(set1.issubset(set2)) # Output: True 1.8 Used in All iterable 1.8.1. in Operator The in operator is used to check if an element is present in an iterable. For example:\n# in string str = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; in str) # Output: True # in list list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(3 in list1) # Output: True # in tuple tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) print(6 in tuple1) # Output: False # in set set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} print(5 in set1) # Output: True # in dictionary dict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30} print(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; in dict1) # Output: True 1.8.2. not in Operator The not in operator is used to check if an element is not present in an iterable. For example:\n# not in string str = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34; not in str) # Output: True # not in list list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(6 not in list1) # Output: True # not in tuple tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) print(5 not in tuple1) # Output: False # not in set set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} print(5 not in set1) # Output: False # not in dictionary dict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30} print(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; not in dict1) # Output: False 1.8.3. len() Function The len() function is used to get the length of an iterable. For example:\n# for string str = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(len(str)) # Output: 13 # for list list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(len(list1)) # Output: 5 # for tuple tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) print(len(tuple1)) # Output: 5 # for set set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} print(len(set1)) # Output: 5 # for dictionary dict1 = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30} print(len(dict1)) # Output: 2 1.8.4. max() and min() Functions The max() function is used to get the maximum value from an iterable, and the min() function is used to get the minimum value for list,string,set and tuples only. for dictionary you can use .keys() or .values() and use it. For example:\n# for list list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(max(list1)) # Output: 5 print(min(list1)) # Output: 1 # for tuple tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) print(max(tuple1)) # Output: 5 print(min(tuple1)) # Output: 1 # for string string = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(max(string)) # Output: r print(min(string)) # Output: \u0026#39; \u0026#39; # for set set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} print(max(set1)) # Output: 5 print(min(set1)) # Output: 1 1.8.5. join() Function The join() function is used to concatenate elements of an iterable with a separator. For example:\n# for list list1 = [\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cherry\u0026#34;] print(\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;.join(list1)) # Output: apple, banana, cherry # for tuple tuple1 = (\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cherry\u0026#34;) print(\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;.join(tuple1)) # Output: apple, banana, cherry # for set set1 = {\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cherry\u0026#34;} print(\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;.join(set1)) # Output: apple, banana, cherry # for string string = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;.join(string)) # Output: H, e, l, l, o, ,, , W, o, r, l, d, !

They allow you to make decisions, repeat tasks, and create complex algorithms. In this guide, we will explore two fundamental control structures in Python: loops and conditionals.\n1. Conditional Statements Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on certain conditions. The most common conditional statements are if, elif, and else.\n1.1. The if Statement The if statement is used to check a condition and execute a block of code if the condition is true.\nExample:\nx = 10 if x \u0026gt; 5: print(\u0026#34;x is greater than 5\u0026#34;) Output:\nx is greater than 5 1.2. The elif Statement The elif statement allows you to check multiple conditions after the initial if statement. If the previous conditions are false, the elif block is evaluated.\nExample:\nx = 5 if x \u0026gt; 5: print(\u0026#34;x is greater than 5\u0026#34;) elif x == 5: print(\u0026#34;x is equal to 5\u0026#34;) Output:\nx is equal to 5 1.3. The else Statement The else statement is used to execute a block of code when all the previous conditions are false.\nExample:\nx = 3 if x \u0026gt; 5: print(\u0026#34;x is greater than 5\u0026#34;) elif x == 5: print(\u0026#34;x is equal to 5\u0026#34;) else: print(\u0026#34;x is less than 5\u0026#34;) Output:\nx is less than 5 2. Loops Loops in Python allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are two main types of loops in Python: for loops and while loops.\n2.1. The while Loop The while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.\nSyntax:\nwhile condition: # Code block else: # Optional else block Example:\ncount = 0 while count \u0026lt; 5: print(count) count += 1 else: print(\u0026#34;Loop completed\u0026#34;) 2.2. The for Loop The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.\nSyntax:\nfor item in sequence: # Code block else: # Optional else block Example:\nfruits = [\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cherry\u0026#34;] for fruit in fruits: print(fruit) else: print(\u0026#34;No more fruits\u0026#34;) 2.3 Using For Loops with different data types 2.3.1. For Loop with Strings Example:\nfor char in \u0026#34;Python\u0026#34;: print(char) Output:\np\ry\rt\rh\ro\rn 2.3.2. For Loop with Lists Example:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for num in numbers: print(num) Output:\n1\r2\r3\r4\r5 2.3.3. For Loop with tuples Example:\nfruits = (\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cherry\u0026#34;) for fruit in fruits: print(fruit) Output:\napple\rbanana\rcherry Tuple unpacking can also be used in for loops to iterate over multiple values in a tuple.\ncoordinates = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)] for x, y in coordinates: print(f\u0026#34;X: {x}, Y: {y}\u0026#34;) Output:\nX: 1, Y: 2\rX: 3, Y: 4\rX: 5, Y: 6 2.3.4. For Loop with Sets Example:\ncolors = {\u0026#34;red\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;green\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;} for color in colors: print(color) Output:\nred\rgreen\rblue 2.3.5. For Loop with Dictionaries Example:\nperson = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;} for key, value in person.items(): print(f\u0026#34;{key}: {value}\u0026#34;) Output:\nname: Alice\rage: 30\rcity: New York 2.4. break , pass and continue statements in loops 2.4.1. The break Statement The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. It terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement after the loop.\nExample:\nfor num in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: if num == 3: break print(num) Output:\n1\r2 2.4.2. The continue Statement The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and jump to the next iteration.\nExample:\nfor num in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: if num == 3: continue print(num) Output:\n1\r2\r4\r5 2.4.3. The pass Statement The pass statement is a null operation that does nothing. It is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any code to execute.\nExample:\nfor num in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: pass ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/python/python_control_structure/","summary":"A detailed examination of Python\u0026rsquo;s control structures, focusing on loops and conditionals to enhance your programming skills.","title":"Python Fundamentals: Mastering Control Structures (Part 3)"},{"content":"Python Fundamentals: Exploring Advanced Operations (Part 4) In Python programming, advanced operations allow you to perform complex tasks efficiently. These operations include working with ranges, enumerations, zip functions, and more. In this guide, we will explore various advanced operations in Python to enhance your programming skills.\n1. Ranges Ranges in Python are used to generate a sequence of numbers. They are commonly used in loops to iterate over a specific range of values. Ranges can be created using the range() function.\n1.1. Creating a Range To create a range of numbers, you can use the range() function with the desired start, stop, and step values where start number is in inclusive and stop number is exclusive.\nExample:\n# Generate a range of numbers from 0 to 9 for i in range(10): print(i) Output:\n0\r1\r2\r3\r4\r5\r6\r7\r8\r9 Example:\n# Generate a range of numbers from 1 to 10 with a step of 2 for i in range(0, 10,2): print(i) Output:\n0\r2\r4\r6\r8 1.2 Enumerate Function The enumerate() function in Python is used to iterate over a sequence while keeping track of the index and value of each item. It returns a tuple containing the index and the value of the item.\nExample:\n# Enumerate a list of fruits fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;cherry\u0026#39;] for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits): print(index, fruit) Output:\n0 apple\r1 banana\r2 cherry Example:\na=\u0026#34;nirajan\u0026#34; for index, char in enumerate(a): print(index, char) Output:\n0 n\r1 i\r2 r\r3 a\r4 j\r5 a\r6 n 1.3. Zip Function The zip() function in Python is used to combine multiple iterables (such as lists) element-wise. It returns an iterator of tuples where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the input iterables.\nExample:\n# Zip two lists together names = [\u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Bob\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Charlie\u0026#39;] ages = [25, 30, 35] for name, age in zip(names, ages): print(name, age) Output:\nAlice 25\rBob 30\rCharlie 35 Example:\na=[1,2,3] b=[4,5,6] c=[7,8,9] print(list(zip(a,b,c))) Output:\n[(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)] 1.5 Sorted Function The sorted() function in Python is used to sort a list of elements. It returns a new sorted list without modifying the original list.The main feature of the sorted() function is that it can take a key argument that specifies a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons.\nExample:\n# Sort a list of numbers numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5] sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers) print(sorted_numbers) Output:\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9] Example:\n# Sort a list of strings based on the length of the string fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;cherry\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;date\u0026#39;] sorted_fruits = sorted(fruits, key=len) print(sorted_fruits) Output:\n[\u0026#39;date\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;cherry\u0026#39;] Example:\n#Sort an dictionary based on the value d = {\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;: 10, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;: 5, \u0026#39;cherry\u0026#39;: 15} sorted_d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]) print(sorted_d) Output:\n[(\u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, 5), (\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, 10), (\u0026#39;cherry\u0026#39;, 15)] Example:\n#Sort a list of tuples based on the second element t = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 6)] sorted_t = sorted(t, key=lambda x: x[1]) print(sorted_t) Output:\n[(3, 1), (1, 2), (5, 6)] #2. Import in Python In Python, the import statement is used to import modules or packages into your script. It allows you to use functions, classes, and variables defined in other modules in your code.\n2.1. Importing Modules To import a module in Python, you can use the import keyword followed by the module name. You can then access the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module using dot notation.\nExample:\n# Import the math module import math # Calculate the square root of a number x = 16 print(math.sqrt(x)) Output:\n4.0 Example:\n# Import the datetime module import datetime # Get the current date and time now = datetime.datetime.now() print(now) Output:\n2024-11-17 10:30:00 2.2. Importing Specific Functions You can import specific functions or variables from a module using the from keyword. This allows you to use the imported functions directly without using the module name.\nExample:\n# Import the pi constant from the math module from math import pi # Print the value of pi print(pi) Output:\n3.141592653589793 Example:\n# Import the date class from the datetime module from datetime import date # Get the current date today = date.today() print(today) Output:\n2024-11-17 2.3. Aliasing Modules You can alias a module or package by using the as keyword. This allows you to refer to the module by a different name in your code.\nExample:\n# Import the math module and alias it as m import math as m # Calculate the square root of a number x = 25 print(m.sqrt(x)) Output:\n5.0 Example:\n# Import the datetime module using import and from and alias it as dt from datetime import datetime as dt now = dt.now() print(now) Output:\n2024-11-17 10:30:00 2.4. Importing All Functions You can import all functions and variables from a module using the * operator. This imports all the functions and variables defined in the module.\nExample:\n# Import all functions from the math module from math import * # Calculate the square root of a number x = 36 print(sqrt(x)) Output:\n6.0 The General Syntax is\nfrom module_name.submodule_name.submodule_name... import funtion_name or variable_name or filename as alias_name\nrandom module The random module in Python is used to generate random numbers. It provides various functions to generate random integers, floating-point numbers, and sequences.\n1. Generating Random Numbers The random module provides functions to generate random numbers within a specified range which can contain both integers starting and ending number.\nExample:\nfrom random import randint # Generate a random integer between 1 and 10 random_number = randint(1, 10) print(random_number) Output:\n5 2.Shuffling a List The random module provides a function to shuffle the elements of a list randomly. It modifies the original list in place.\nExample:\nfrom random import shuffle # Shuffle a list of numbers numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] shuffle(numbers) print(numbers) Output:\n[3, 1, 5, 2, 4] ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/python/python_advanced_operations/","summary":"An in-depth exploration of advanced Python operations to enhance your programming skills.","title":"Python Fundamentals: Exploring Advanced Operations (Part 4)"},{"content":"Python Fundamentals: Understanding Functions In Python programming, functions are essential building blocks that allow you to organize and reuse code effectively. Functions help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks, making your code more readable and maintainable. In this guide, we will explore the fundamentals of Python functions, including their syntax, parameters, return values, and more.\n1. Defining Functions A function in Python is defined using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. You can also specify parameters inside the parentheses if the function requires input values.\nSyntax:\ndef function_name(parameters): # Function body # Statements Example:\ndef greet(): print(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;) 2. Calling Functions To call a function in Python, you simply write the function name followed by parentheses. If the function requires input values, you can pass them inside the parentheses.\nSyntax:\nfunction_name(arguments) Example:\ngreet() 3. return Statement The return statement in Python is used to exit a function and return a value to the caller. You can use the return statement to send a result back to the calling code.\nSyntax:\ndef function_name(parameters): # Function body return value Demostration using all:\ndef add_numbers(a, b): return a + b result = add_numbers(5, 3) print(result) 4. Args , Default Args and Kwargs 4.1. Args Using Args you can pass any number of arguments to a function. The arguments are passed as a tuple.\nSyntax:\ndef function_name(*args): # Function body Example:\ndef display_args(*args): print(args) display_args(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Output:\n(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 4.2. Default Args Default arguments are used when you do not pass a value for an argument in the function call. If a value is not provided, the default value is used.\nSyntax:\ndef function_name(arg=value): # Function body Example:\ndef add(a,b,c=0): return a+b+c result = add(5,3) print(result) result = add(5,3,2) print(result) Output:\n8\r10 4.3. Kwargs Using Kwargs you can pass any number of keyword arguments to a function. The arguments are passed as a dictionary.\nSyntax:\ndef function_name(**kwargs): # Function body Example:\ndef display_kwargs(**kwargs): print(kwargs) display_kwargs(name=\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, age=30, city=\u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;) Output:\n{\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;age\u0026#39;: 30, \u0026#39;city\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;New York\u0026#39;} 4.4. Combination of Args and Kwargs Example:\ndef display_args_kwargs(*args, **kwargs): print(args) print(kwargs) display_args_kwargs(1, 2, 3, name=\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, age=30) Output:\n(1, 2, 3)\r{\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;age\u0026#39;: 30} 4.5. Unpacking Args and Kwargs Example:\ndef display_args_kwargs(*args, **kwargs): print(args) print(kwargs) args = (1, 2, 3) kwargs = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30} display_args_kwargs(*args, **kwargs) Output:\n(1, 2, 3)\r{\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;age\u0026#39;: 30} 5. Lambda Functions Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small, single-expression functions that do not require a name. They are defined using the lambda keyword.\nSyntax:\nlambda arguments: expression Example:\nadd = lambda a, b: a + b result = add(5, 3) print(result) Output:\n8 6.Map and filter functions 6.1. Map Function The map() function in Python applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or set) and returns a new iterable with the results.\nSyntax:\nmap(function, iterable) Example:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers) print(list(squared)) Output:\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25] 6.2. Filter Function The filter() function in Python filters elements from an iterable based on a given function. It returns an iterator with the elements that satisfy the condition.\nSyntax:\nfilter(function, iterable) Example:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] even = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers) print(list(even)) Output:\n[2, 4] 7.Local and Global Variables 7.1. Local Variables Local variables are defined within a function and are only accessible within that function. They are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits.\nExample:\ndef display(): message = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; print(message) display() # Trying to access the local variable outside the function will result in an error print(message) # NameError: name \u0026#39;message\u0026#39; is not defined 7.2. Global Variables Global variables are defined outside any function and can be accessed from any part of the code. You can use the global keyword to modify a global variable inside a function.\nExample:\nmessage = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; def display(): print(message) display() # Modifying a global variable inside a function def change_message(): global message message = \u0026#34;Hello, Python!\u0026#34; change_message() print(message) Output:\nHello, World!\rHello, Python! 7.3. Local vs. Global Variables If a local variable has the same name as a global variable, the local variable takes precedence within the function scope.\nExample:\nmessage = \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; def display(): message = \u0026#34;Hello, Python!\u0026#34; print(message) display() print(message) Output:\nHello, Python!\rHello, World!

Understanding React Hooks Hooks are special functions in React that start with the word \u0026ldquo;use\u0026rdquo;. They allow you to add state and other React features to functional components.\n17.1. Rules of Hooks There are 3 important rules you must follow when using hooks:\nOnly use hooks in React components or custom hooks\n// ✅ Correct - Inside a component function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); return \u0026lt;button onClick={() =\u0026gt; setCount(count + 1)}\u0026gt;{count}\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt;; } // ❌ Incorrect - Outside a component const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // This will cause an error Only call hooks at the top level\nfunction Counter() { // ✅ Correct - At the top level const [count, setCount] = useState(0); if (count \u0026gt; 0) { // ❌ Incorrect - Inside a condition const [error, setError] = useState(null); // Never do this } } Hooks can be used in custom hooks\n// ✅ Correct - Custom hook using other hooks function useWindowSize() { const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 0, height: 0 }); // ...rest of the logic return size; } 18. useState: Your First Hook The useState hook is the most common hook you\u0026rsquo;ll use. It lets you add state to functional components.\n18.1. Basic Syntax and Usage function Counter() { // Declare state variable with initial value const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // ^ ^ ^ // | | └── Initial value // | └── Function to update state // └── State variable return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You clicked {count} times\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button onClick={() =\u0026gt; setCount(count + 1)}\u0026gt;Click me\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } 18.2. Multiple State Variables function UserForm() { const [name, setName] = useState(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); const [age, setAge] = useState(0); const [isStudent, setIsStudent] = useState(false); return ( \u0026lt;form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input value={name} onChange={(e) =\u0026gt; setName(e.target.value)} /\u0026gt; {/* ...other form elements... */} \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; ); } 18.3. Updating State Correctly Wrong Way (State Updates May Be Lost): function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); const handleTripleIncrement = () =\u0026gt; { // ❌ These might not work as expected setCount(count + 1); setCount(count + 1); setCount(count + 1); }; } Correct Way (Using Updater Function): function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); const handleTripleIncrement = () =\u0026gt; { // ✅ This guarantees three increments setCount(prev =\u0026gt; prev + 1); setCount(prev =\u0026gt; prev + 1); setCount(prev =\u0026gt; prev + 1); }; } 18.4. Common Pitfalls and Solutions State Updates are Asynchronous function Example() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); const handleClick = () =\u0026gt; { setCount(count + 1); console.log(count); // Shows old value // Solution: Use useEffect if you need to react to state changes // useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { // console.log(count); // Shows new value // }, [count]); }; } Objects in State function UserProfile() { // ✅ Correct way to update object state const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, age: 0 }); const updateName = (newName) =\u0026gt; { setUser(prev =\u0026gt; ({ ...prev, // Keep existing properties name: newName // Update only what\u0026#39;s needed })); }; } 19. Complete useState Example import { useState } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; function TodoApp() { const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]); const [input, setInput] = useState(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); const addTodo = () =\u0026gt; { if (input.trim()) { setTodos(prev =\u0026gt; [...prev, input]); setInput(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); // Clear input after adding } }; return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input value={input} onChange={(e) =\u0026gt; setInput(e.target.value)} placeholder=\u0026#34;Add a todo\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button onClick={addTodo}\u0026gt;Add\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; {todos.map((todo, index) =\u0026gt; ( \u0026lt;li key={index}\u0026gt;{todo}\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; ))} \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } export default TodoApp; ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/react/react1/","summary":"A detailed guide to help you understand and use hooks in React effectively.","title":"React Hooks: A Comprehensive Guide"},{"content":"1. Create A React Project To create a React app we use Vite and its command is:\nnpm create vite@latest 2. Component In a React application, one page is broken down into multiple components. Components allow:\nReusability: For example, we can create one component for cards and use it to create multiple cards with different data. Related code lives together: Related items (JS code) are stored together. Separation of logic: Different components handle different data and logic. Diagram 3. Folder Structure my-app/\r├─ node_modules/\r├─ public/\r│ ├─ index.html\r│ ├─ image.png\r│ └─ favicon.ico\r├─ src/\r│ ├─ index.js\r│ ├─ App.js\r│ ├─ App.css\r│ └─ index.css\r├─ package.json\r└─ README.md node_module: Contains all the files of installed packages.\npublic: All static files are kept in this folder. For example, if image.png is in public, we can access it in the browser as 127.0.0.1:8000/image.png.\nindex.html: It is the page that is served to us and its content is managed by React using the DOM.Modify this file if you want to change the title or favicon.\npackage.json: Contains all the configuration of the project, package list, versions, and all related information.\nsrc: This is the folder where all the code is written.\nsrc/index.js React runs this file first.Code of index.js\nThe DOM selects the element of index.html whose id is root because of this code: document.getElementById('root') Then render() renders the \u0026lt;App/\u0026gt; component so that the root element will contain the data of the \u0026lt;App/\u0026gt; component. All changes are done in the index.html root element using the DOM. Remember that we never edit this file (code). src/App.js : This is where we will write all the SPA code. We start coding from App.jsx and link components as required.\nsrc/index.css : This CSS file is used by main.jsx, so it applies to the whole page. You can remove it if needed by removing its import in main.jsx.\n*** src/App.css:*** This CSS file is used by App.jsx, so it applies to all App components.\nRemember: Component functions must follow two rules:\nThe name should start with an uppercase letter (e.g., Head, MyHead). The function must return renderable content. The function must return a value that can be rendered (displayed on screen) by React. In most cases, return JSX. Example of a simple component:\nfunction App() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello world\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } As we know, App.jsx is provided by default when we create a React app. We can modify it and tailor it to our requirements\n4. Making Custom Components function FunctionName() { return ( \u0026lt;tagname\u0026gt; content \u0026lt;/tagname\u0026gt; ); } Important Note:\nTags that don\u0026rsquo;t have ending tags, such as \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;, should be written as \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;hr/\u0026gt;. class is replaced by className. For example, \u0026lt;body class=\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;\u0026gt; is written as \u0026lt;body className=\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;\u0026gt;. During a return in React, we cannot return multiple elements directly. Instead, we need to wrap them inside a single parent element like \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/\u0026gt;. For Example :\nWrong Way: function component1() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; Hi \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; Hello \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } right way: function component1() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; {/* or \u0026lt;\u0026gt; */} \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; Hi \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; Hello \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {/* or \u0026lt;/\u0026gt; */} ); } 5.Using One Component Inside Another Component To use one component inside another in React, follow the steps\nCreate a component. function Comp1() { return \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; Component \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; } Use the component inside another component. function Comp2() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Comp1 /\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;Comp1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Comp1 /\u0026gt; content \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ) } Here, Comp1 is used inside Comp2.We can use Comp1 multiple times inside Comp2 as needed. Note: For proper management, create a components folder, create one file for each component, and export from there. Then, import and use it in another component.\nExample structure:\nsrc/\r├─ Assets/\r├─ App.jsx\r└─ Components/\r├─ Comp1.jsx\r└─ Comp2.jsx Task: Break Down a Component into Multiple Components\nfunction App() { return ( \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; I am header \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;main\u0026gt; I am main content \u0026lt;/main\u0026gt; \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; I am footer \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/\u0026gt; ); } Solution: components/Header.jsx\nfunction Header() { return ( \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; I am header \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; ); } export default Header; components/Footer.jsx\nfunction Footer() { return ( \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; I am footer \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt; ); } export default Footer; Finally, App.jsx\nimport Header from \u0026#39;./components/Header\u0026#39;; import Footer from \u0026#39;./components/Footer\u0026#39;; function App() { return ( \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Header /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;main\u0026gt; I am main content \u0026lt;/main\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Footer /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/\u0026gt; ); } export default App; structure:\nsrc/\r├─ Assets/\r├─ App.jsx\r└─ components/\r├─ Header.jsx\r└─ Footer.jsx Note: You Can Always break down a component as many times as you want. The main goal is to make the code more readable and maintainable.\n6. Some Component Hierarchies Examples THis is the simple example of a component hierarchy. 7. Embedding JavaScript code in JSX In JSX, we can embed JavaScript code using curly braces {}. We can write any JavaScript code inside the curly braces. For example, we can write a variable, function, or any JavaScript expression but of single line.\nfunction componentName() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; { JavaScript code } \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } Example:\nfunction App() { const name = \u0026#39;John Doe\u0026#39;; return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Hello, {name} \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } Where To Write Javascript Logic?\nWe can write JavaScript logic inside the component function. We can write JavaScript logic outside the component function and use it inside the component function. 7.1 Using JavaScript Logic Outside Component Function syntax:\n// Multiple lines of JavaScript code function ComponentName() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; {/* JSX code */} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } 7.2 Using JavaScript Logic Inside Component Function syntax:\nfunction ComponentName() { // Multiple lines of JavaScript code return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; {/* JSX code */} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } When to use Inside Component Function Outside Component Function Use Case When the logic is specific to the component and not used anywhere else. When the logic is used in multiple components. Advantages Logic is specific to the component. Logic can be reused in multiple components. Disadvantages Logic cannot be reused in other components. Logic is not specific to the component. Combined Example Task1: Create a component that generate random number between 1 to 10 and display in every page reload\nfunction RandomNumber(){ return \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Random Number: {Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; } export default RandomNumber; This can be done in another ways which is more readable and maintainable\nfunction RandomNumber(){ const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1; return \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Random Number: {randomNumber}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; } export default RandomNumber; Task2 : Create a component that generate random element from an array and display on each page reload\nconst elements = [\u0026#39;Earth\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Water\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Fire\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Air\u0026#39;]; function generateRandomElement(){ return elements[Math.floor(Math.random() * elements.length)]; } function RandomElement(){ const randomElement = generateRandomElement(); return \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Random Element: {randomElement}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; } export default RandomElement; This can be done by putting the logic inside the component function\nconst elements = [\u0026#39;Earth\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Water\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Fire\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Air\u0026#39;]; function generateRandomElement(){ return elements[Math.floor(Math.random() * elements.length)]; } function RandomElement(){ const randomElement = elements[Math.floor(Math.random() * elements.length)]; return \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Random Element: {randomElement}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; } export default RandomElement; The most optimal way is using this\nconst elements = [\u0026#39;Earth\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Water\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Fire\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Air\u0026#39;]; function RandomElement(){ const randomElement = elements[Math.floor(Math.random() * elements.length)]; return \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Random Element: {randomElement}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; } export default RandomElement; 8.Loading Images in React step 1: put the images in assets folder that need to be loaded step 2: import the image in the component where it is needed as shown below import imageName from Location Note: Location is the path of the image from the current file location and imageName can be set to any name\nstep 3: use the image in the component as shown below \u0026lt;img src={imageName} alt=\u0026#34;description\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Note: imageName is the location of the image as src/Assets/logo.png\nTask: Load an image in a Header component with the image name logo.png and description logo. structure:\nsrc/\r├─ Assets/\r└─ logo.png\r├─ App.jsx\r└─ components/\r├─ Header.jsx import logo from \u0026#39;../Assets/logo.png\u0026#39;; function Header() { return ( \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src={logo} alt=\u0026#34;logo\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; ); } 9.Importing CSS in React step 1: create a css file in the src folder step 2: import the css file in the component where it is needed as shown below import cssfileLocation Note: style.css is the name of the css file\nfor example:\nimport \u0026#39;./style.css\u0026#39; function App() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Hello world \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } 9.1 Managing CSS in React Create css file in same directory as of your component src/ ├─ App.jsx └─ components/ ├─ Header.jsx └─ Header.css -Import the css file in the component where it is needed as shown below\r```jsx\rimport \u0026#39;./Header.css\u0026#39; 10.Props in React Props are used to pass data from parent component to child component. It is used to reuse the same component with different data. Props are passed as attributes to the component. Prop accept any type of value like string, number, array, object, function,bool etc. 10.1 Passing Props from Parent to Child Component Parent Component function ParentComponent() { return ( \u0026lt;ChildComponent prop1={value1} prop2={value2} /\u0026gt; ); } 10.2 Receiving Props in Child Component Child Component function ChildComponent(props) { console.log(props); // will print object of props {prop1: value1, prop2:value2} return ( \u0026lt;\u0026gt; {props.prop1} {props.prop2} \u0026lt;/\u0026gt; ); } This approach is not recommended because it is not clear what props are being passed to the component. Instead, we can destructure the props as shown below.\n10.3 Destructuring Props Child Component function ChildComponent({prop1, prop2}) { return ( \u0026lt;\u0026gt; {prop1} {prop2} \u0026lt;/\u0026gt; ); } Task: Create a card cmponent and use multiple cards in the App component to make card section\nfunction Card({title, description, image}) { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{title}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;{description}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src={image} alt=\u0026#34;description\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } export default Card; import Card from \u0026#39;./components/Card\u0026#39;; function App() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Card title=\u0026#34;Card 1\u0026#34; description=\u0026#34;This is card 1\u0026#34; image={image1} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Card title=\u0026#34;Card 2\u0026#34; description=\u0026#34;This is card 2\u0026#34; image={image2} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } export default App; 11. Children Props in React Children props are used to pass data between opening and closing tags of a component. 11.1 Passing Children Props Parent Component function ParentComponent() { return ( \u0026lt;ChildComponent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Hello \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; World \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ChildComponent\u0026gt; ); } 11.2 Receiving Children Props Child Component function ChildComponent({ children }) { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; {children} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } 11.3 Output \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Hello \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; World \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 12.Using Props and Children Props Together Task: Create a card component that accepts title, description, and children props. Use the card component in the App component to make a card section.\nfunction Card({ title, description, children }) { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{title}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;{description}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; {children} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } export default Card; import Card from \u0026#39;./components/Card\u0026#39;; function App() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Card title=\u0026#34;Card 1\u0026#34; description=\u0026#34;This is card 1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Hello \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; World \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Card\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Card title=\u0026#34;Card 2\u0026#34; description=\u0026#34;This is card 2\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Hello \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; World \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Card\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } 13. Making a Button Component 13.1 Using Props function App() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Button text=\u0026#34;Click me\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } function Button({ text}) { return ( \u0026lt;button\u0026gt; {text} \u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; ); } export default Button; 13.2 Using Children Props function App() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Button\u0026gt;Click me\u0026lt;/Button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } function Button({ children }) { return ( \u0026lt;button\u0026gt; {children} \u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; ); } export default Button; 14. Reacting to Events In React, we can add event listeners like onClick, onMouseOver, onMouseOut, etc to buildin components lie button, div, etc using syntax \u0026lt;InbuiltComponent eventlistener={functionName} /\u0026gt; Note: functionName is the name of the function that will be called when the event is triggered.\nThere are Many eventlisteners that can be used in React like onClick, onMouseOver, onMouseOut etc.\nYou can check the full list of event listeners in the React documentation also note that the event listener will always start with on followed by the event name.\nWe can call the handle function in two ways:\n14.1 The First Way function App() { function handleClick() { console.log(\u0026#39;Button clicked\u0026#39;); } return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button onClick={handleClick}\u0026gt;Click me\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } 14.2 The Second Way function App() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button onClick={() =\u0026gt; {console.log(\u0026#39;Button clicked\u0026#39;)}}\u0026gt;Click me\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } 15. Event Listeners in Custom Components since by default when we add event listeners to custom component it doesnot work just because it is passed as prop but on simple tweaking we can make it work\nDesign Pattern for applying event listeners in custom components\nfunction App(){ function handleClick(){ console.log(\u0026#39;Button clicked\u0026#39;); } return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Button onClick={handleClick} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } The onclick method is passed as a prop to the button component and then used in the button component as shown below\nfunction Button({onClick}){ return ( \u0026lt;button onClick={onClick}\u0026gt;Click me\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; ); } 16. Passing Arguments to Event Functions To pass Custom arguments to event functions, we can use the arrow function syntax as shown below \u0026lt;inbuildComponent eventListener={() =\u0026gt; functionName(argument)} /\u0026gt; Example function App() { function handleClick(name) { console.log(\u0026#39;Button clicked by\u0026#39;, name); } return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button onClick={() =\u0026gt; handleClick(\u0026#39;John\u0026#39;)}\u0026gt;Click me\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/react/react/","summary":"A detailed reference guide to help you quickly set up and manage React projects, components, and folder structures.","title":"React Quick Reference Guide"},{"content":"Python Fundamentals: Understanding Error Handling In Python programming, error handling is an essential concept that allows you to gracefully manage exceptions and errors that may occur during program execution. By handling errors effectively, you can prevent your program from crashing and provide meaningful feedback to users. In this guide, we will explore the fundamentals of error handling in Python, including exceptions, try-except blocks, and best practices.\n1. Exceptions In Python, exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of code. When an exception occurs, the interpreter raises an exception object that can be caught and handled by the program. Exceptions can be caused by various reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, or division by zero.\n2.What May Cause Exceptions Exceptions can be caused by various reasons, such as:\nDivision by zero Invalid input File not found Syntax errors Out of Index of list, tuple , String Key Error in dictionary 3.Types of Exceptions Commonly used exceptions in Python include:\nZeroDivisionError: Raised when division or modulo by zero occurs. ValueError: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value. TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type. IndexError: Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range. KeyError: Raised when a dictionary key is not found. SyntaxError: Raised when the parser encounters a syntax error. Note: All exceptions in Python are subclasses of the Exception class.\n3.Handling Exceptions To handle exceptions in Python, you can use the try-except block, which allows you to catch and handle exceptions gracefully. The try block contains the code that may raise an exception, and the except block handles the exception if it occurs.The program control will transfer the control to the except block if any exception occurs in the try block but if there is not exception then the control will not transfer to the except block.\n4.1. Using try-except Block Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of using the try-except block to handle exceptions in Python:\nsyntax:\ntry: # Code that may raise an exception except ExceptionType as e: # Handle the exception Example:\ntry: x = 10 / 0 except Exception as e: print(\u0026#34;Error: Division by zero\u0026#34;) Output:\nError: Division by zero Note: if you don\u0026rsquo;t know the type of exception you can use Exception to catch all exceptions.\nIf you dont handel exception then it will show error and stop the program.\n4.2. Finally Block The finally block is used to execute code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. The finally block is typically used to release resources or clean up operations that need to be performed after the try block, regardless of the outcome Any how the finally block will run. if yout return from the try block then also the finally block will run.\nsyntax:\ntry: # Code that may raise an exception except ExceptionType as e: # Handle the exception finally: # Code that always runs Example:\ntry: x = 10 / 0 except Exception as e: print(\u0026#34;Error: Division by zero\u0026#34;) finally: print(\u0026#34;Cleanup code\u0026#34;) Output:\nError: Division by zero\rCleanup code 3.5. Raising Exceptions You can raise exceptions in Python using the raise statement. This allows you to create custom exceptions and raise them when needed. You can also raise built-in exceptions to indicate errors or exceptional conditions.\nsyntax:\nraise ExceptionType(\u0026#34;Error message\u0026#34;) Example:\nx = -1 if x \u0026lt; 0: raise ValueError(\u0026#34;Value cannot be negative\u0026#34;) Output:\nValueError: Value cannot be negative 3.6. Multiple except Blocks You can use multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions in Python. This allows you to catch and handle specific exceptions based on their type.\nsyntax:\ntry: # Code that may raise an exception except ExceptionType1 as e: # Handle ExceptionType1 except ExceptionType2 as e: # Handle ExceptionType2 Example:\ntry: x = 10 / 0 except ZeroDivisionError as e: print(\u0026#34;Error: Division by zero\u0026#34;) except ValueError as e: print(\u0026#34;Error: Invalid value\u0026#34;) Output:\nError: Division by zero 3.7. Custom Exceptions You can create custom exceptions in Python by defining a new exception class that inherits from the Exception class. Custom exceptions allow you to define specific error conditions for your application and raise them when needed.\nsyntax:\nclass CustomException(Exception): pass Example:\n#Will read about class in oop section class CustomError(Exception): def __init__(self,message,value): self.message=message self.value=value def __str__(self): return f\u0026#34;{self.message}\\nError code:{self.value}\u0026#34; try: x = -1 if x \u0026lt; 0: raise CustomError(\u0026#34;Value cannot be negative\u0026#34;,1001) except CustomError as e: print(e) Note: Custom exceptions should inherit from the Exception class or one of its subclasses. You can simply use:\ntry: #code except: #code try: #code except Exception as e: #code try: #code except Exception: #code try: #code except: #code finally: #code ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/python/python_error_handeling/","summary":"An in-depth exploration of Python error handling, exceptions, and best practices.","title":"Python Fundamentals: Understanding Error Handling (Part 6)"},{"content":"Python Fundamentals: Packages, Generators, and Decorators In this guide, we will explore advanced Python topics including packages, generators, and decorators. These concepts are essential for writing efficient and maintainable Python code. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive in!\n1. Python Packages Python packages are a way of organizing and structuring your code into reusable modules. Packages allow you to group related modules together, making it easier to manage and maintain your codebase. In this section, we will explore how to create and use Python packages.\n1.1. Creating a Package To create a Python package, you need to organize your code into a directory structure with a special file called __init__.py. This file tells Python that the directory is a package and allows you to import modules from the package.\nExample directory structure:\nmy_package/\r│\r├── __init__.py\r├── module1.py\r└── module2.py 1.2. Using a Package To use a Python package, you can import modules from the package using the import statement. You can import specific modules or the entire package.\nExample:\n# Importing a specific module from my_package import module1 # Using a function from the imported module module1.my_function() # Importing the entire package import my_package # Using a function from a module within the package my_package.module2.another_function() #Importing Function from a module from my_package.module1 import my_function my_function() Note : init.py file can be empty or contain initialization code for the package. It will automatically run when the package is imported.\n1.3 Creating a Subpackage You can create subpackages within a package to further organize your code. Subpackages are simply packages within packages, allowing you to create a hierarchical structure for your codebase.\nExample directory structure:\nmy_package/\r│\r├── __init__.py\r├── module1.py\r└── subpackage/\r├── __init__.py\r├── module3.py\r└── module4.py 1.4. Using a Subpackage To use a subpackage, you can import modules from the subpackage using the dot notation.\nExample:\n# Importing a module from a subpackage from my_package.subpackage import module3 # Using a function from the imported module module3.another_function() # Importing the entire subpackage import my_package.subpackage # Using a function from a module within the subpackage my_package.subpackage.module4.some_function() #Importing Function from a module from my_package.subpackage.module3 import another_function another_function() 1.5. name == \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; We use the __name__ variable to check if a script is being run as the main program or being imported as a module. When a script is run as the main program, __name__ is set to \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;. This allows you to include code that should only run when the script is executed directly.\nFor Example:\nStructure:\nMain Directory/\r├── main.py\r└── package/\r├── __init__.py\r└── module1.py module1.py:\ndef my_function(): print(\u0026#34;Hello from module1\u0026#34;) if __name__ == \u0026#34;__main__\u0026#34;: my_function() When you run module1.py directly, the my_function() will be executed. However, if you import module1 into another script, the my_function() will not be executed.\nFor Example:\nfrom package import module1 print(\u0026#34;Imported module1\u0026#34;) Output:\nImported module1 When use Dont use if __name__ == \u0026quot;__main__\u0026quot;: in module1.py:\ndef my_function(): print(\u0026#34;Hello from module1\u0026#34;) my_function() also,\nfrom package import module1 print(\u0026#34;Imported module1\u0026#34;) Output:\nHello from module1\rImported module1 2. Python Generators Using generator we can instantly return all the values using the yield keyword without storing them in memory. This is useful when working with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n2.1. Creating a Generator To create a generator in Python, you can use a function with the yield keyword. When a function contains the yield keyword, it becomes a generator function. The yield keyword suspends the function\u0026rsquo;s execution and returns a value to the caller.\nExample:\ndef my_generator(): yield 1 yield 2 yield 3 # Using the generator gen = my_generator() print(next(gen)) # Output: 1 print(next(gen)) # Output: 2 print(next(gen)) # Output: 3 Example:\n#using generator in loop def generate(n): for i in range(n): yield i for i in generate(10): print(i) 3. Python Decorators Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods. Decorators are functions that take another function as an argument and return a new function that extends the behavior of the original function.\n3.1. Creating a Decorator To create a decorator in Python, you can define a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that extends the behavior of the original function.\nSyntax:\ndef my_decorator(func): def wrapper(): # Code to execute before calling the decorated function func() # Code to execute after return wrapper Example:\ndef my_decorator(func): def wrapper(): print(\u0026#34;Before function call\u0026#34;) func() print(\u0026#34;After function call\u0026#34;) return wrapper @my_decorator def say_hello(): print(\u0026#34;Hello!\u0026#34;) say_hello() #call to my_decorator(say_hello)() just because we use @my_decorator Output:\nBefore function call\rHello!\rAfter function call Example For decorator :\ndef Add_Wrapper(func): def wrapper(a,b,c): print(\u0026#34;Status code is\u0026#34;,c) return func(a,b) return wrapper @Add_Wrapper def add(a,b): return a+b print(add(2,3,200)) Output:\nStatus code is 200\r5 3.2. Decorator with Arguments You can also create decorators that accept arguments by defining a decorator function that takes arguments and returns a decorator function.\nSyntax:\ndef my_decorator_with_args(arg1, arg2): def decorator(func): def wrapper(): # Code to execute before calling the decorated function func() # Code to execute after return wrapper return decorator Example:\ndef my_decorator_with_args(arg1, arg2): def decorator(func): def wrapper(): print(f\u0026#34;Decorator arguments: {arg1}, {arg2}\u0026#34;) func() return wrapper return decorator @my_decorator_with_args(\u0026#34;arg1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;arg2\u0026#34;) def say_hello(): print(\u0026#34;Hello!\u0026#34;) say_hello() Output:\nDecorator arguments: arg1, arg2\rHello!

This package is used to make HTTP requests in python. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive in!\n1. Python request Python request is a simple and elegant HTTP library for Python. It provides methods for sending HTTP requests and handling the responses. The requests library allows you to send HTTP requests using a simple and intuitive API, and it also provides support for handling cookies, sessions, and authentication.\n1.1. Installing requests To use the requests library in your Python project, you need to install it using pip. You can install the requests library by running the following command in your terminal:\npip install requests 1.2. Types of requests The requests library supports various types of HTTP requests, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more. You can use these methods to interact with web services and APIs.\nExample:\nimport requests # Send a GET request response = requests.get(\u0026#39;https://api.github.com\u0026#39;) # Send a POST request response = requests.post(\u0026#39;https://httpbin.org/post\u0026#39;) # Send a PUT request response = requests.put(\u0026#39;https://httpbin.org/put\u0026#39;) # Send a DELETE request response = requests.delete(\u0026#39;https://httpbin.org/delete\u0026#39;) 1.3 Parameters for requests The requests library allows you to pass various parameters when making HTTP requests. These parameters include headers, query parameters, request body, and more.\nHeaders: You can pass custom headers in your request using the headers parameter.

You can refer to the official documentation for more details.\n** Note ** : While using json it will automatically set the content type to application/json and dump the data to json format but while using data it will set the content type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded and encode the data to urlencoded format.\n1.4. Handling responses The requests library provides methods for handling the responses returned by HTTP requests. You can access the response content, status code, headers, and more.\nResponse content: You can access the response content using the text attribute. Example: import requests # Send a GET request response = requests.get(\u0026#39;https://api.github.com\u0026#39;) # Get the response content content = response.text print(content) Response Content in bytes: You can access the response content in bytes using the content attribute. Example: import requests # Send a GET request response = requests.get(\u0026#39;https://api.github.com\u0026#39;) # Get the response content in bytes content = response.content print(content) json: You can access the response content as JSON using the json method. Example:\nimport requests # Send a GET request response = requests.get(\u0026#39;https://api.github.com\u0026#39;) # Get the response content as JSON data = response.json() print(data) Status code: You can access the response status code using the status_code attribute. Example: import requests # Send a GET request response = requests.get(\u0026#39;https://api.github.com\u0026#39;) # Get the response status code status_code = response.status_code print(status_code) Headers: You can access the response headers using the headers attribute. Example: import requests # Send a GET request response = requests.get(\u0026#39;https://api.github.com\u0026#39;) # Get the response headers headers = response.headers print(headers) Cookies: You can access the response cookies using the cookies attribute.

Files are used to store data permanently, and Python provides various functions and methods to work with files efficiently. In this guide, we will explore the basics of file handling in Python, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files.\n1.Context Manager Python provides a built-in way to manage resources and ensure that they are properly released when they are no longer needed. This is done using the with statement and is known as a context manager. When working with files, it is recommended to use the with statement to ensure that the file is properly closed after use.\n1.1. Using the with Statement The with statement in Python is used to create a context manager that automatically takes care of resource management. When working with files, the with statement ensures that the file is properly closed after use, even if an error occurs during file operations.\nExample:\nwith open(\u0026#34;example.txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;) as file: data = file.read() print(data) 2. Opening a File Before you can read or write to a file, you need to open it using the open() function. The open() function takes two arguments: the file path and the mode in which you want to open the file.\n2.1. Modes for Opening Files Python supports various modes for opening files, depending on the operations you want to perform. Some common modes include:\nr: Read mode. Opens the file for reading. The file must exist. w: Write mode. Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it will be truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. a: Append mode. Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, the data will be appended to the end. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. b: Binary mode. Opens the file in binary mode.use for image,video,etc as it will not convert the data to text .You can add b to any mode to open the file in binary mode like rb,wb,ab. t: Text mode. Opens the file in text mode (default). 2.2. Opening a File To open a file, you can use the open() function with the desired file path and mode. You can also specify additional parameters such as encoding, buffering, and newline characters.\nExample:\n# Open a file in read mode with open(\u0026#34;example.txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;) as file: data = file.read() print(data) 3. Reading from a File Once you have opened a file, you can read its contents using various methods provided by Python. The most common methods for reading from a file is read().\n# Open a file in read mode with open(\u0026#34;example.txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;) as file: data = file.read() print(data) 4. Writing to a File To write data to a file, you can use the write() method provided by Python. You can write text data to a file using the write() method.\nUsing w mode: # Open a file in write mode with open(\u0026#34;example.txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;w\u0026#34;) as file: file.write(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;) Using a mode: # Open a file in append mode with open(\u0026#34;example.txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;) as file: file.write(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;) 5.Context Manager Reference\nUse of Context Manager: In any programming language, the usage of resources like file operations or database connections is very common. But these resources are limited in supply. Therefore, the main problem lies in making sure to release these resources after usage. If they are not released then it will lead to resource leakage and may cause the system to either slow down or crash. It would be very helpful if users have a mechanism for the automatic setup and teardown of resources. In Python, it can be achieved by the usage of context managers which facilitate the proper handling of resources.\nWhat is happened When the with statement is executed, it will automatically call the __enter__ before entering the code block, and __exit__ after exiting the code block.\nHow to create a context manager To create a context manager, you need to define a class that implements the __enter__ and __exit__ methods. The __enter__ method is called when the with statement is executed, and the __exit__ method is called after the code block is executed.\nSyntax:\nclass MyContextManager: def __init__(self,params): # Code to initialize resources def __enter__(self): # Code to setup resources return self def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback): # Code to release resources Example:\n#implementatio of own file handeling context manager class MeroHandle: def __init__(self,filename,mode): self.filename = filename self.mode = mode def __enter__(self): self.file = open(self.filename,self.mode) return self.file def __exit__(self,exc_type,exc_value,traceback): self.file.close() #using the context manager with MeroHandle(\u0026#34;example.txt\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;r\u0026#34;) as file: data = file.read() print(data) Normal way of file handeling try: file = open(\u0026#34;example.txt\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;r\u0026#34;) data = file.read() print(data) file.close() except: print(\u0026#34;Error Occured\u0026#34;) Advantage of context manager Over normal code When we use normal code shown above then when error occured in try block before file.close() then it will not close the file(i.e file will not be closed) and it will lead to resource leakage . But when we use context manager then it will automatically close the file just because __exit__ method is called after the code block is executed whether error occured or not. but in normal code we can manage this by using finally block but it is not recommended as it is not pythonic way of doing things. try: file = open(\u0026#34;example.txt\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;r\u0026#34;) data = file.read() print(data) except: print(\u0026#34;Error Occured\u0026#34;) finally: file.close() This will work but it is not pythonic way of doing things.Just because we have to write whole try,except,finally block for just opening and closing the file. which make code more complex and lengthy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/python/python_filehandeling/","summary":"An in-depth look at File Handeling.","title":"Python Fundamentals: Understanding File Handeling (Part 9)"},{"content":"Python Fundamentals: Some Important Package to Know In Python programming, packages are collections of modules that provide additional functionality to your programs. Python has a rich ecosystem of packages that can help you perform a wide range of tasks, from data analysis and visualization to web development and machine learning. In this guide, we will explore some of the most important packages in Python that you should be familiar with.\n1.json The json package in Python provides functions for encoding and decoding JSON data. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. The json package allows you to work with JSON data in Python by converting Python objects to JSON strings and vice versa.\nConversion of Python dictionary to JSON string We can convert a Python dictionary to a JSON string using the json.dumps() function. This function takes a Python object as input and returns a JSON string representation of the object. Example:\nimport json # Create a Python dictionary data = { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34; } # Convert the dictionary to a JSON string json_string = json.dumps(data) print(json_string) Conversion of JSON string to Python dictionary We can convert a JSON string to a Python dictionary using the json.loads() function. This function takes a JSON string as input and returns a Python object (usually a dictionary) representing the JSON data. Example:\nimport json # JSON string json_string = \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New York\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; # Convert the JSON string to a Python dictionary data = json.loads(json_string) print(data) 2.os The os package in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system.You can get indepth knowladge of os using its own documentation.but the most common methods are:\nos.path.join(\u0026quot;C:\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;users\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;bin\u0026quot;): Join one or more path components intelligently. os.rename(\u0026quot;old\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;new\u0026quot;): Rename a file or directory. 3.time The time package in Python provides functions for working with time-related tasks. You can use the time package to get the current time, sleep for a specified duration, and measure the execution time of your code.\ntime.time(): Returns the current time in seconds since the epoch. time.sleep(seconds): Suspends the execution of the current thread for the given number of seconds. 4.uuid The uuid package in Python provides functions for generating and working with UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers). UUIDs are unique identifiers that are used to identify objects in a distributed computing environment. The uuid package allows you to generate UUIDs based on various algorithms and formats.\nGenerating a UUID You can generate a UUID using the uuid.uuid4() function, which generates a random UUID. Example:\nimport uuid # Generate a random UUID uuid_value = uuid.uuid4() print(uuid_value) 5.Datetime The datetime package in Python provides classes for working with dates and times. You can use the datetime package to create, manipulate, and format dates and times in your Python programs.\nCreating a datetime object You can create a datetime object using the datetime.datetime() constructor, which takes the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond as input. Example:\nimport datetime # Create a datetime object dt = datetime.datetime(2022, 11, 27, 10, 30, 0) print(dt) Output:\n2022-11-27 10:30:00 get current date and time You can get the current date and time using the datetime.now() method. Example:\nimport datetime # Get the current date and time now = datetime.datetime.now() print(now) Output:\n2022-11-27 10:30:00 Formatting a datetime object some Properties of datetime object:\nyear: The year of the datetime object month: The month of the datetime object (1-12) day: The day of the datetime object (1-31) hour: The hour of the datetime object (0-23) minute: The minute of the datetime object (0-59) second: The second of the datetime object (0-59) import datetime # Create a datetime object dt = datetime.datetime.now() # Format the datetime object print(dt.month()) print(dt.day()) print(dt.year()) print(dt.hour()) print(dt.minute()) print(dt.second()) Output:\n11\r27\r2022\r10\r30\r0 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/python/python_extrapackage/","summary":"An in-depth look at frequently used important package.","title":"Python Fundamentals: Some Important Package to Know (Part 10)"},{"content":"Shared References in Python: How Changes Propagate Across Variables In Python, variables are references to objects in memory.

Class and Object Class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).\nObject is an instance of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.\n1.1 Creating a class We can create a class using the class keyword followed by the class name. The class definition can contain class variables, instance variables, methods, and constructors.\nSyntax:\nclass ClassName: #code block Example:\nclass Person: name=\u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34; age=20 classes=\u0026#34;Bachelor\u0026#34; 1.2 Creating an object To create an object of a class, we use the class name followed by parentheses. This calls the constructor method of the class and returns an object.\nSyntax:\nobject_name = ClassName() Example:\nperson1 = Person() 1.3 Accessing class attributes We can access the attributes of a class using the dot operator (.) followed by the attribute name.\nSyntax:\nobject_name.attribute_name Example:\nprint(person1.name) # Output: Nirajan print(person1.age) # Output: 20 print(person1.classes) # Output: Bachelor 1.4 Modifying class attributes We can modify the attributes of a class using the dot operator (.) followed by the attribute name.\nSyntax:\nobject_name.attribute_name = new_value Example:\nperson1.age = 21 print(person1.age) # Output: 21 1.5 Creating a member function We can create a member function (method) inside a class using the def keyword followed by the function name. The first parameter of the method should be self, which refers to the current instance of the class.we will see about self in next part.\nSyntax:\nclass ClassName: def method_name(self, parameters): #code block Example:\nclass Person: name=\u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34; age=20 classes=\u0026#34;Bachelor\u0026#34; def display(self): print(f\u0026#34;Name: {self.name}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Age: {self.age}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Class: {self.classes}\u0026#34;) 1.6 Calling a member function We can call a member function of a class using the dot operator (.) followed by the function name and parentheses.\nSyntax:\nobject_name.method_name(arguments) Example:\nperson1.display() 1.7 Nested member function We can call a member function from another member function of the same class using the self keyword.\nSyntax:\nclass ClassName: def method1(self): #code block self.method2() def method2(self): #code block Example:\nclass Person: name=\u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34; age=20 classes=\u0026#34;Bachelor\u0026#34; def display(self): print(f\u0026#34;Name: {self.name}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Age: {self.age}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Class: {self.classes}\u0026#34;) self.greet() def greet(self): print(\u0026#34;Hello, Welcome to the class\u0026#34;) 1.8 self parameter The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables and methods of the class. It is the first parameter of any method in a class.\nSyntax:\nclass ClassName: def method_name(self, parameters): #code block Example:\nclass Person: name=\u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34; age=20 classes=\u0026#34;Bachelor\u0026#34; def display(self): print(f\u0026#34;Name: {self.name}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Age: {self.age}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Class: {self.classes}\u0026#34;) self.greet() def greet(self): print(\u0026#34;Hello, Welcome to the class\u0026#34;) 2. Constructor in Python A constructor is a special type of method (function) which is used to initialize the instance members of the class. It is called when an object of the class is created.\n2.1 Creating a constructor In Python, the constructor method is called __init__. It is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created.\nSyntax:\nclass ClassName: def __init__(self, parameters): #code block Example:\nclass Person: def __init__(self, name, age, classes): self.name = name self.age = age self.classes = classes def display(self): print(f\u0026#34;Name: {self.name}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Age: {self.age}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Class: {self.classes}\u0026#34;) 2.2 Creating an object with constructor When an object is created, the constructor method is automatically called with the arguments passed to the class.\nSyntax:\nobject_name = ClassName(arguments) Example:\nperson1 = Person(\u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34;, 20, \u0026#34;Bachelor\u0026#34;) 3. Getters and Setters in Python 3.1. Getters Getters are methods is implementes by using the @property decorator. They are specially used\nto act as an value ie data instead of a method. to access the value of a private attribute without directly accessing it. Syntax:\nclass ClassName: @property def method_name(self): #code block Example:\nclass Person: def __init__(self, name, age): self._name = name self._age = age @property def display(self): return f\u0026#34;Name: {self._name}, Age: {self._age}\u0026#34; person1 = Person(\u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34;, 20) print(person1.display) # Output: Name: Nirajan, Age: 20 3.2. Setters Setters are methods is implementes by using the @method_name.setter decorator. They are specially used\nto set the value of a private attribute without directly setting it. to perform validation before setting the value of an attribute. Syntax:\nclass ClassName: @method_name.setter def method_name(self, value): #code block Example:\nclass Person: def __init__(self, name, age): self._name = name self._age = age @property def display(self): return f\u0026#34;Name: {self._name}, Age: {self._age}\u0026#34; @display.setter def display(self, value): self._name, self._age = value.split(\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;) self._age = int(self._age) person1 = Person(\u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34;, 20) print(person1.display) # Output: Name: Nirajan, Age: 20 person1.display = \u0026#34;Alice, 30\u0026#34; print(person1.display) # Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30 4. Inheritance in Python Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class. The class which inherits the properties and behavior is known as the child class, and the class whose properties and behavior are inherited is known as the parent class.\n4.1. Creating a child class To create a child class that inherits from a parent class, we specify the parent class in parentheses after the child class name.\nSyntax:\nclass ChildClassName(ParentClassName): #code block Example:\nclass Employee: def __init__(self,name,age,id): self.name=name self.age=age self.id=id def display(self): print(f\u0026#34;Name: {self.name}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Age: {self.age}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;ID: {self.id}\u0026#34;) class Manager(Employee):# it has all the properties of Employee class so we can access the # properties of Employee class also its method using object of Manager class def task(self): self.display() print(\u0026#34;Assigning tasks to employees\u0026#34;) class Developer(Employee): # it has all the properties of Employee class so we can access # the properties of Employee class also its method using object of Developer class def task(self): self.display() print(\u0026#34;Developing software applications\u0026#34;) manager1 = Manager(\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, 30, 101) manager1.task() developer1 = Developer(\u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;, 25, 102) developer1.task() Note : Only public and protected members are inherited by the child class. Private members are not inherited by the child class.\n5.Ascess Specifiers in Python 5.1. Public members Public members are accessible from outside the class.

To explicitly call the parent class\u0026rsquo;s method, we can use the super() function.\nTo explicitly invoke the parent class\u0026rsquo;s version of the method, the super() function is used. This is especially useful when the child class\u0026rsquo;s method needs to build upon or extend the functionality of the parent class\u0026rsquo;s method.\nSyntax:\nsuper().method_name() Example:\nclass Person: def display(self): print(\u0026#34;Person class\u0026#34;) class Student(Person): def display(self): super().display() print(\u0026#34;Student class\u0026#34;) student1 = Student() student1.display() # Output: # Person class # Student class Example:\nclass Person: def __init__(self,name,age): self.name=name self.age=age class Student(Person): def __init__(self,name,age,roll): super().__init__(name,age) self.roll=roll def display(self): print(f\u0026#34;Name: {self.name}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Age: {self.age}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Roll: {self.roll}\u0026#34;) student1 = Student(\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, 30, 101) student1.display() # Output: # Name: Alice # Age: 30 # Roll: 101 Note: Use super for single inheritance only. For multiple inheritance, use the class name directly.\nMagic/dunder methods in Python Magic methods are special methods that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names. They are also known as dunder methods (short for \u0026ldquo;double underscore\u0026rdquo;). Magic methods are used to define the behavior of objects. They are automatically called when certain operations are performed on objects. Some of the commonly used magic methods are:\n__init__: Constructor method, called when an object is created. __str__: Called by the str() built-in function to return a string representation of an object. __repr__: Called by the repr() built-in function to return an unambiguous string representation of an object. __add__: Called by the + operator to perform addition. __len__: Called by the len() built-in function to return the length of an object. __call__: Called when an object is called as a function. Note : All magic method can be seen using dir(objectname) method and we can override the magic method in our class.\nexample of all method:\nclass Person: def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name self.age = age def __str__(self): return f\u0026#34;Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}\u0026#34; def __repr__(self): return f\u0026#34;Person(\u0026#39;{self.name}\u0026#39;, {self.age})\u0026#34; def __add__(self, other): return self.age + other.age def __len__(self): return len(self.name) def __call__(self): return f\u0026#34;Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}\u0026#34; person1 = Person(\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, 30) person2 = Person(\u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;, 25) print(person1) # Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30 print(repr(person1)) # Output: Person(\u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, 30) print(person1 + person2) # Output: 55 print(len(person1)) # Output: 5 print(person1()) # Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30 Method Overriding Method overriding is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature, and same return type as a method in its parent class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the parent class. Example:\nclass Person: def display(self): print(\u0026#34;Person class\u0026#34;) class Student(Person): def display(self): print(\u0026#34;Student class\u0026#34;) student1 = Student() student1.display() # Output: Student class We can also call the parent class\u0026rsquo;s method from the overridden method using the super() function.\nExample:\nclass Person: def display(self): print(\u0026#34;Person class\u0026#34;) class Student(Person): def display(self): super().display() #Or Person.display(self) print(\u0026#34;Student class\u0026#34;) student1 = Student() student1.display() # Output: # Person class # Student class Operator overloading in Python Operator overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows us to define the behavior of operators for user-defined objects. It allows us to define the behavior of operators such as +, -, *, /, ==, !=, etc., for objects of a class. To overload an operator, we need to define a special method in the class that corresponds to the operator. These special methods are called magic methods or dunder methods.\nExample:\nclass Point: def __init__(self, x, y): self.x = x self.y = y def __add__(self, other): x = self.x + other.x y = self.y + other.y return Point(x, y) def __str__(self): return f\u0026#34;({self.x}, {self.y})\u0026#34; point1 = Point(1, 2) point2 = Point(3, 4) point3 = point1 + point2 print(point3) # Output: (4, 6) Types of Inheritance in Python Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class.

MRO (Method Resolution Order) in Python Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which methods are resolved in the inheritance hierarchy. It defines the order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method.\nfor example:\nclass C: f=\u0026#34;dirajan\u0026#34; class A(C): f=\u0026#34;nirajan\u0026#34; class B(C): f=\u0026#34;kirajan\u0026#34; class D(A,B): pass def display(self): print(self.f) d=D() print(D.__mro__) d.display() Output:\n(\u0026lt;class \u0026#39;__main__.D\u0026#39;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;class \u0026#39;__main__.A\u0026#39;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;class \u0026#39;__main__.B\u0026#39;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;class \u0026#39;__main__.C\u0026#39;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;class \u0026#39;object\u0026#39;\u0026gt;)\rnirajan It means it will search for the method in the order of D-\u0026gt;A-\u0026gt;B-\u0026gt;C-\u0026gt;object if the method is not found in the D it will search in A and so on. but if the method is found in the D it will not search in the A,B,C and object.\n15.Class Inside a Class in Python A class can be defined inside another class.

It enables non-blocking operations, making it possible to execute long-running tasks without freezing the main program.\nFor example:\nconsole.log(\u0026#39;Start\u0026#39;); setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;This message is delayed by 2 seconds\u0026#39;); }, 2000); console.log(\u0026#39;End\u0026#39;); When you run this code, the output will be:\nStart\rEnd\rThis message is delayed by 2 seconds Explanation:\nconsole.log('Start'); is executed, and \u0026ldquo;Start\u0026rdquo; is printed. setTimeout() sets up a callback function to run after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) but does not block the next line. console.log('End'); is executed immediately after, and \u0026ldquo;End\u0026rdquo; is printed. After 2 seconds, the callback function in setTimeout() is executed, and \u0026ldquo;This message is delayed by 2 seconds\u0026rdquo; is printed. This demonstrates how asynchronous functions like setTimeout() work without blocking the execution of subsequent code.\nPromises Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never. Promises can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. They allow us to run code when the promise is fulfilled or rejected using the .then() and .catch() methods.\nSyntax to create a new Promise:\nconst promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u0026gt; { // Perform an asynchronous operation // If successful, call resolve(value) // If an error occurs, call reject(error) }); Why We Use Promises Consider the following code:\nfunction main() { setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;); }, 1000); } main(); main(); main(); This code waits for 1 second and then logs \u0026ldquo;Hello\u0026rdquo; three times instantly. But what if we want to wait for the first to be completed before the second?\nThis can be solved using promises:\nfunction promise() { return new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u0026gt; { setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;); resolve(\u0026#34;Done\u0026#34;); }, 2000); }); } let data = promise(); When a promise is called, it returns a promise object instantly in a pending state. When the asynchronous operation completes, the promise is either fulfilled or rejected.\nHandling Promises To do a task when the promise is fulfilled (resolved):\ndata.then((data) =\u0026gt; { console.log(data); }); To do a task when the promise is rejected:\ndata.catch((err) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Promise rejected\u0026#34;, err); }); Handling Multiple Promises function promise1() { return new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u0026gt; { setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Promise 1 resolved\u0026#34;); resolve(\u0026#34;Done 1\u0026#34;); }, 2000); }); } function promise2() { return new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u0026gt; { setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Promise 2 resolved\u0026#34;); resolve(\u0026#34;Done 2\u0026#34;); }, 2000); }); } function promise3() { return new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u0026gt; { setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Promise 3 resolved\u0026#34;); resolve(\u0026#34;Done 3\u0026#34;); }, 2000); }); } let data1 = promise1(); let data2 = promise2(); let data3 = promise3(); How Promises Work:\npromise1 is called. promise2 is called immediately. promise3 is called immediately, regardless of whether the previous promises are resolved. To execute promises one by one:\nlet data1 = promise1(); data1.then((data) =\u0026gt; { console.log(data); return promise2(); }).then((data) =\u0026gt; { console.log(data); return promise3(); }).then((data) =\u0026gt; { console.log(data); }).catch((err) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Error\u0026#34;, err); }); Here, the first promise will run, then the second, then the third, and so on, one by one.\nAsync and Await Async functions always return a promise. await is used to wait for a promise to be resolved, such that the code below it will not run until the promise is resolved.\nTo use await, we need to use an async function:\nasync function main() { console.log(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;); } main(); Example with await:\nlet promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u0026gt; { setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { resolve(\u0026#34;Done\u0026#34;); }, 2000); }); async function main() { console.log(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;); await promise; console.log(\u0026#34;Hello again\u0026#34;); } main(); console.log(\u0026#34;Hi\u0026#34;); What happens here is the main function is called, it prints \u0026ldquo;Hello\u0026rdquo;, then waits for 2 seconds to resolve. During that time, it prints \u0026ldquo;Hi\u0026rdquo;. When the promise is resolved, it prints \u0026ldquo;Hello again\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen await is called, the function pauses its execution until the promise is resolved. Then it continues the execution of the function, such that code below await will not run until the promise is resolved, but the code outside the function will run.\nasync function main() { console.log(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;); await promise; await promise; await promise; console.log(\u0026#34;Hello again\u0026#34;); } Here, the first promise is resolved, then the second is resolved, and so on.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/js/asyncronous/","summary":"A complete guide to asynchronous programming in JavaScript, covering promises and async/await.","title":"Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript"},{"content":"Basics of Vim Vim is a powerful text editor, often used in the command line, that is known for its efficiency and speed once mastered. Here are the basic commands and modes that you need to get started.\nOpening a File To open a file in Vim, use the following command:\nvim filename Replace filename with the name of the file you wish to open.\nBasic Modes in Vim Vim operates in different modes, and understanding these modes is crucial for using Vim effectively:\nNormal Mode: This is the default mode when you open a file. In this mode, you can navigate, delete, copy, and paste text. To return to Normal Mode from other modes, press Esc.\nInsert Mode: This mode allows you to insert text into the file. To enter Insert Mode, press i. After you\u0026rsquo;re done typing, press Esc to go back to Normal Mode.\nCommon Commands Here are some essential commands for working with files in Vim:\nSave the current file:\n:w This writes (saves) changes to the file.\nQuit Vim:\n:q To quit Vim. If there are unsaved changes, Vim will warn you. You can force quit without saving using:\n:q! Save changes and quit:\n:wq or\n:x These commands save changes and then exit Vim.\nTips for Beginners Press Esc frequently to return to Normal Mode, as it helps you avoid unintended actions while in other modes. Practice using both Normal and Insert modes to become comfortable with the flow of editing and saving files in Vim. Vim can be intimidating at first, but with practice, it becomes an extremely efficient tool for editing text files, especially in programming and development environments.

Run a Container from an Image To create and run a container from an image:\ndocker run image 2. Run a Container in Interactive Mode To run a container and open its terminal:\ndocker run -it image After the container starts, you can interact with it directly in the terminal. 3. Name a Container To give a container a specific name:\ndocker run --name container_name image 4. Port Mapping To map a port from your computer to the container:\ndocker run -p computer_port:container_port image Incoming traffic to computer_port will be forwarded to container_port in the container. 5. Run a Container in the Background (Detached Mode) To run the container in the background:\ndocker run -d image 6. Passing Environment Variables to a Container To pass environment variables to a container:\ndocker run -e key=value image 🛠️ Managing Containers 7. Start a Container To start an existing container:\ndocker start container_id 8. Stop a Container To stop a running container:\ndocker stop container_id 9. Remove a Container To remove a container:\ndocker rm container_id Note: The container must be stopped before removal. 10. Execute a Command in a Running Container To start a terminal session inside a running container:\ndocker exec -it container_id bash 11. View Running Containers To list all currently running containers:\ndocker ps 12. View All Containers (Running and Stopped) To see all containers, including those that are stopped:\ndocker ps -a 🧱 Building Docker Images 13. Creating a Dockerfile A Dockerfile is a script used to build Docker images. Here’s an example of common Dockerfile commands:\n# Set the base image for your container FROM base_image # Run commands during the image build process RUN command # Copy files from your local machine to the container COPY source /path/in/container # Set environment variables ENV key=value # Expose a port for the container EXPOSE 8080 # Define the command to run when the container starts CMD [\u0026#34;executable\u0026#34;] # Optionally, run commands automatically when the container starts ENTRYPOINT [\u0026#34;/path/to/script\u0026#34;] # Set the working directory in the container WORKDIR /app # Copy all files from the local directory to the container, excluding files listed in .dockerignore COPY . . 14. Building a Docker Image To build a Docker image from a Dockerfile:\ndocker build -t image_name /path/to/Dockerfile 📂 Managing Docker Files 15. Using the .dockerignore File The .dockerignore file helps exclude unnecessary files from being copied into the Docker image, improving build speed and reducing image size:\nnode_modules/ .git/ 16. COPY Command in Dockerfile The COPY command copies files from your local system to the container:\nCopy all files from the current directory to the container: COPY . /path/in/container Copy a specific file: COPY ./filename.extension /path/in/container Copy an entire folder: COPY ./foldername /path/in/container Copy contents of a folder (not the folder itself): COPY ./foldername/ /path/in/container 📦 Working with Volumes 17. Mounting Volumes Volumes allow data to persist even if the container is deleted. To mount a folder from your host to the container:\ndocker run -it -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container image Example: docker run -it -v /home/user/backup:/app/data ubuntu This will map /home/user/backup on your host to /app/data inside the container. Use Cases for Volumes: Data Persistence: Preserve data even after the container is removed. Backups: Easily back up container data to the host. Shared Data: Share data between multiple containers or between host and container. 💾 Publishing Docker Images 18. Pushing an Image to Docker Hub To publish an image to Docker Hub:\nTag the image with your Docker Hub username: docker tag image_name username/image_name Log in to Docker Hub: docker login Push the image to your repository: docker push username/image_name This guide gives you the essentials for working with Docker.

With Docker Compose, you can use a YAML file to configure your application\u0026rsquo;s services and create and start all the services from your configuration with a single command.\nBasic docker-compose.yml Structure The docker-compose.yml file is where you define the services that make up your app. A typical file might look like this:\nversion: \u0026#39;3.8\u0026#39; services: service_name: image: image_name:tag ports: - \u0026#34;host_port:container_port\u0026#34; environment: - ENV_VAR=value volumes: - \u0026#34;host_path:container_path\u0026#34; depends_on: - dependency_service Example Configurations Example 1: Basic Setup with PostgreSQL and Redis version: \u0026#39;3.8\u0026#39; services: postgres: image: postgres ports: - \u0026#34;5432:5432\u0026#34; environment: POSTGRES_USER: postgres POSTGRES_DB: review POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password redis: image: redis ports: - \u0026#34;80:80\u0026#34; Example 2: Real-World Application version: \u0026#39;3\u0026#39; services: pythonapp: image: your-python-image:tag ports: - \u0026#34;8000:8000\u0026#34; volumes: - /Users/data:/src/bin/data depends_on: - db - redis db: image: postgres environment: POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase POSTGRES_USER: myuser POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword redis: image: redis volumes: - /path/to/local/directory:/data Example 3: Building from Dockerfile version: \u0026#39;3\u0026#39; services: pythonapp: build: context: . dockerfile: Dockerfile ports: - \u0026#34;8000:8000\u0026#34; volumes: - /Users/desktop:/src/bin/desktop depends_on: - db - redis db: image: postgres environment: POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase POSTGRES_USER: myuser POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword redis: image: redis volumes: - /path/to/local/directory:/data Example 4: Django Application with PostgreSQL and Redis version: \u0026#39;3.8\u0026#39; services: django-app: container_name: django-app image: django-app:latest # Replace with your actual Django image name/tag ports: - \u0026#34;8000:8000\u0026#34; # Expose Django app on port 8000 environment: - DEBUG=1 # Set Django debug mode to 1 for development - POSTGRES_HOST=postgres # PostgreSQL host - POSTGRES_DB_NAME=nirajan # PostgreSQL database name - POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD=nirajan@9845 # PostgreSQL database password - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0 # Redis URL depends_on: - postgres - redis volumes: - static_volume:/code/static # Volume for Django static files - media_volume:/code/media # Volume for Django media files postgres: container_name: postgres image: postgres:latest environment: POSTGRES_DB: nirajan # Database name POSTGRES_USER: nirajan # Database username POSTGRES_PASSWORD: nirajan@9845 # Database password volumes: - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data redis: container_name: redis image: redis:latest ports: - \u0026#34;6379:6379\u0026#34; Service Names as Hostnames In Docker Compose, the names of the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file are used as hostnames for inter-service communication.\nService Names as Hostnames Each service name in the docker-compose.yml file acts as a hostname for that service. For example, in the configuration above:\nThe django-app service can connect to the postgres service using POSTGRES_HOST=postgres. The django-app service can connect to the redis service using REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0. Example In the django-app service:\nPostgreSQL Host: POSTGRES_HOST=postgres — The Django app connects to the PostgreSQL service using the hostname postgres, which matches the name of the PostgreSQL service defined in Docker Compose. Redis Host: REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0 — The Django app connects to the Redis service using the hostname redis, which matches the name of the Redis service defined in Docker Compose. Note: In Docker, services within a Docker Compose setup are typically connected to the same network by default. This allows containers to communicate with each other using service names as hostnames.\nDocker Compose Commands To start the containers defined in docker-compose.yml:\nsudo docker compose up To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes created by docker-compose up:\nsudo docker compose down To run the containers in the background (detached mode):\nsudo docker compose up -d Tips Use depends_on to specify dependencies between services. This ensures that the dependent services start in the correct order. Use volumes to persist data outside of your containers, which is especially useful for databases. Use environment variables to configure your services and avoid hardcoding sensitive information. Conclusion Docker Compose simplifies the process of managing multi-container Docker applications. By defining your services in a docker-compose.yml file, you can easily spin up your entire application stack with a single command.

Here\u0026rsquo;s a detailed guide on how to use these options:\nDocker CLI Commands Setting CPU Limits:\nOption: --cpus Usage: Specifies the number of CPUs that the container can use. Example: docker run --cpus=\u0026#34;1.5\u0026#34; my-image The --cpus option limits the container to 1.5 CPU cores. Setting Memory Limits:\nOption: --memory or -m\nUsage: Sets the maximum amount of memory the container can use.\nExample:\ndocker run --memory=\u0026#34;500m\u0026#34; my-image This command limits the container to 500MB of RAM. If the limit is exceeded, the container will be throttled or terminated.\nNote: The options take a positive integer followed by suffixes such as b, k, m, or g to indicate bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes.\nSoft Memory Limits:\nOption: --memory-reservation Example: docker run --memory=\u0026#34;1g\u0026#34; --memory-reservation=\u0026#34;512m\u0026#34; nginx This reserves 512MB of memory while setting a hard limit of 1GB.

Port Mapping docker run -p host_port:container_port imagename This command maps a container\u0026rsquo;s port to a port on the host machine. 2. Host Network To share the host\u0026rsquo;s network namespace with the container:\ndocker run --network host imagename 🌐 Accessing Container Ports from Another Container To allow inter-container communication, you need to create and use a custom Docker network.\nSteps: 1. Create a Docker Network docker network create my_network 2. Run Containers in the Same Network docker run --network my_network --name container1 imagename docker run --network my_network --name container2 imagename 3. Access One Container from Another Use the container name and port to access one container from another:\ncontainer1:port Example Scenario Create a Network docker network create my_network Run First Container docker run --network my_network --name webserver -d nginx Run Second Container docker run --network my_network --name client -it alpine /bin/sh Access Web Server from Client Inside the client container, use the following commands to access the web server: wget -qO- http://webserver or\ncurl http://webserver 📝 Important Notes Container-to-Container Access: Containers in the same custom network can communicate using their names as hostnames. Host Machine Access: Containers cannot directly access the host machine\u0026rsquo;s ports. External Access: Use port mapping or host networking to access container ports from outside the host machine.

In this guide, we will explain how you can create content for Hugo using Markdown.\n1. Front Matter Every Markdown file in Hugo requires front matter, which is metadata placed at the top of the file. It helps Hugo understand how to process the file.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My First Hugo Post\u0026#34; date: 2024-10-18 tags: [\u0026#34;Hugo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Markdown\u0026#34;] summary: \u0026#34;A brief summary of the post.\u0026#34; --- 2. Headers Headers are used to organize content. Use one # for an H1 header, two ## for H2, and so on.\nExample:\n# H1 Header ## H2 Header ### H3 Header Output:\nH3 Header 3. Text Formatting Markdown supports several text formatting options:\nExample:\n**Bold Text** *Italic Text* ~~Strikethrough~~ Output: Bold Text\nItalic Text\nStrikethrough\n4. Spacing and Line Breaks In Markdown, you can create paragraphs by leaving a blank line between lines of text.\nExample:\nThis is the first paragraph. This is the second paragraph. Output: This is the first paragraph.\nThis is the second paragraph.\n5. Horizontal Rules You can create horizontal lines (dividers) using three or more dashes (---), asterisks (***), or underscores (___).\nExample:\n--- Output:\n6. Lists Create unordered lists with - or *, and ordered lists with numbers followed by periods.\nExample:\n- Item 1 - Item 2 1. First item 2. Second item Output:\nItem 1 Item 2 First item Second item 7. Links and Images Add links and images with square brackets [] and parentheses ().\nExample:\n[Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io) ![Hugo Logo](/images/hugo.webp) Output: Hugo Documentation\n8. Code Blocks For inline code, use backticks. For block code, use triple backticks.\nExample:\nInline code: `print(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;)` Output: Inline code: print(\u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot;)\nExample:\nBlock Code: def hello(): print(\u0026#34;Hello, Hugo!\u0026#34;) def hello(): print(\u0026#34;Hello, Hugo!\u0026#34;) 9. Blockquotes Use the greater than symbol (\u0026gt;) to create blockquotes.\nExample:\n\u0026gt; This is a blockquote in Hugo. Output:\nThis is a blockquote in Hugo.\n10. Tables You can create tables using pipes | and dashes -.\nExample:\n| Column 1 | Column 2 | |----------|----------| | Row 1 | Data 1 | | Row 2 | Data 2 | Output:\nColumn 1 Column 2 Row 1 Data 1 Row 2 Data 2 11. Task Lists Create task lists by using square brackets []. An x in the brackets [x] marks a task as completed.\nExample:\n- [ ] Task 1 - [x] Task 2 (Completed) Output:\nTask 1 Task 2 (Completed) 12. Syntax Highlighting Hugo supports syntax highlighting for various programming languages. You can specify the language after the triple backticks(```).\nExample: Output:\ndef greet(): print(\u0026#34;Hello, Hugo!\u0026#34;) 12. Task Lists Create task lists by using square brackets []. An x in the brackets [x] marks a task as completed.\nExample:\n- [ ] Task 1 - [ ] Sub-task 1 - [x] Sub-task 2 (Completed) - [x] Task 2 (Completed) Output:\nTask 1 Sub-task 1 Sub-task 2 (Completed) Task 2 (Completed) 13. Escaping Special Characters To use special characters like #, escape them using a backslash \\.\nExample:\n\\# This is not a header Output: # This is not a header\n14. Backtick To display backtick use four space before it as\n``` 15. Consistency It\u0026rsquo;s important to maintain consistent formatting throughout your Markdown files to ensure a clean and readable structure.\nBy following these steps, you can effectively create well-formatted content for your Hugo site using Markdown.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/hugo/markdown_hugo_content_guide/","summary":"A tutorial on creating content with Markdown in Hugo.","title":"How to Create Content for Hugo"},{"content":"JavaScript Reference Behavior: Objects and Arrays Introduction In JavaScript, both objects and arrays are considered reference types. This means that when you assign an object or an array to another variable, you’re not creating a new copy of that object or array. Instead, the new variable holds a reference to the original object or array in memory. Understanding this concept is crucial because it directly affects how data is manipulated and shared within your code.\nObject Reference Behavior 1. Overview When you work with objects in JavaScript, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to recognize that assigning an object to a new variable does not create a new object. Instead, it creates a reference to the original object. This means that any changes made through the new reference will affect the original object.\n2. Example const person = { name: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, address: { city: \u0026#34;Wonderland\u0026#34; } }; const newPerson = person.address; // newPerson now references the same object as person.address newPerson.city = \u0026#34;New Wonderland\u0026#34;; // modifying newPerson affects the original object console.log(person); // Output: { name: \u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, address: { city: \u0026#39;New Wonderland\u0026#39; } } ## JavaScript Reference Behavior: Objects and Arrays ### Introduction In JavaScript, both objects and arrays are considered reference types. This means that when you assign an object or an array to another variable, you’re not creating a new copy of that object or array. Instead, the new variable holds a reference to the original object or array in memory. Understanding this concept is crucial because it directly affects how data is manipulated and shared within your code. ### Object Reference Behavior #### 1. Overview When you work with objects in JavaScript, it\u0026#39;s essential to recognize that assigning an object to a new variable does not create a new object. Instead, it creates a reference to the original object. This means that any changes made through the new reference will affect the original object. #### 2. Example ```javascript const person = { name: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, address: { city: \u0026#34;Wonderland\u0026#34; } }; const newPerson = person.address; // newPerson now references the same object as person.address newPerson.city = \u0026#34;New Wonderland\u0026#34;; // modifying newPerson affects the original object console.log(person); // Output: { name: \u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, address: { city: \u0026#39;New Wonderland\u0026#39; } } 3. Explanation Object Reference: When you create const newPerson = person.address;, you\u0026rsquo;re not making a copy of the address object. Instead, newPerson references the same address object that person.address references. Thus, when you update newPerson.city = \u0026quot;New Wonderland\u0026quot;;, it directly modifies the person.address object because both newPerson and person.address are pointing to the same location in memory. Output: The console logs the person object, which now reflects the change: { name: 'Alice', address: { city: 'New Wonderland' } }. Array Reference Behavior 1. Overview Arrays in JavaScript behave similarly to objects in terms of reference handling. When you assign an array to another variable, you create a reference to the original array. As a result, any modifications through this reference will affect the original array.\n2. Example const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; const moreNumbers = numbers; // moreNumbers now references the same array as numbers moreNumbers[0] = 99; // modifying moreNumbers affects the original array console.log(numbers); // Output: [99, 2, 3] 3. Explanation Array Reference: When you create const moreNumbers = numbers;, you\u0026rsquo;re not creating a new array. Instead, moreNumbers becomes a reference to the same array that numbers references. Any changes to moreNumbers, such as moreNumbers[0] = 99, directly modify the numbers array because both variables point to the same array in memory. Output: The console logs the numbers array, which now reflects the change: [99, 2, 3]. Key Takeaways Reference Types: Both objects and arrays are reference types in JavaScript, meaning that variables assigned to them hold references to the same data in memory. Shared Modifications: Changes made to an object or array through one reference will affect all other references to that same object or array. Memory Efficiency: This reference behavior allows for memory-efficient data management but requires careful handling to avoid unintended side effects. JavaScript References with filter() and find() In JavaScript, the way references work with methods like filter() and find() is different, leading to distinct behaviors. Understanding these differences is crucial for working effectively with arrays and avoiding unintended side effects.\nfilter(): Creating a New Array 1. Overview The filter() method in JavaScript creates a new array that contains only the elements that satisfy the provided condition. This means that a new array is returned, and it does not affect the original array. However, if the elements in the array are objects, the references to these objects are retained, meaning any modifications to the objects in the new array will also affect the original array.\n2. Example const originalArray = [ { id: 1, name: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34; }, { id: 2, name: \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34; }, { id: 3, name: \u0026#34;Charlie\u0026#34; } ]; const filteredArray = originalArray.filter(item =\u0026gt; item.id !== 2); // Modify an object in the filtered array filteredArray[0].name = \u0026#34;Alicia\u0026#34;; console.log(originalArray); // Output: [{ id: 1, name: \u0026#39;Alicia\u0026#39; }, { id: 2, name: \u0026#39;Bob\u0026#39; }, { id: 3, name: \u0026#39;Charlie\u0026#39; }] console.log(filteredArray); // Output: [{ id: 1, name: \u0026#39;Alicia\u0026#39; }, { id: 3, name: \u0026#39;Charlie\u0026#39; }] 3. Explanation New Array Creation: The filter() method creates a new array (filteredArray) that includes all elements from originalArray except the one with id 2. However, the objects within the new array are still references to the original objects in originalArray. Shared References: When you modify the name property of the first object in filteredArray (filteredArray[0].name = \u0026quot;Alicia\u0026quot;;), it also changes in originalArray because both arrays reference the same object in memory. Output: The original array shows that the name of the first object has been changed to \u0026ldquo;Alicia\u0026rdquo;, indicating that the object references are shared. find(): Returning a Single Element Reference 1. Overview The find() method returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided condition. This element is not a copy but a reference to the original element in the array. As a result, any modification to this element directly affects the original array.\n2. Example const originalArray = [ { id: 1, name: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34; }, { id: 2, name: \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34; }, { id: 3, name: \u0026#34;Charlie\u0026#34; } ]; const foundItem = originalArray.find(item =\u0026gt; item.id === 2); // Modify the found item foundItem.name = \u0026#34;Robert\u0026#34;; console.log(originalArray); // Output: [{ id: 1, name: \u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39; }, { id: 2, name: \u0026#39;Robert\u0026#39; }, { id: 3, name: \u0026#39;Charlie\u0026#39; }] console.log(foundItem); // Output: { id: 2, name: \u0026#39;Robert\u0026#39; } 3. Explanation Element Reference: The find() method returns a reference to the first element that meets the condition (item.id === 2). In this case, foundItem references the same object in memory as the element in originalArray with id: 2. Direct Modification: When you modify the name property of foundItem (foundItem.name = \u0026quot;Robert\u0026quot;;), it directly alters the corresponding object in originalArray because they are the same object in memory. Output: The original array now shows that the name of the object with id: 2 has been changed to \u0026ldquo;Robert\u0026rdquo;, demonstrating that the reference was modified. Key Differences Between filter() and find() New Array vs. Single Element: filter(): Returns a new array containing references to elements that meet the condition. find(): Returns a reference to the first element that meets the condition. Impact on Original Array: filter(): The original array remains unchanged, but the objects within the new array are still references to the original objects. find(): The original array can be directly modified through the returned element. Use Cases: Use filter() when you need a subset of the original array without altering it directly. Use find() when you need to retrieve and possibly modify a specific element from the array. Conclusion Understanding how references work with methods like filter() and find() is crucial in JavaScript. While filter() returns a new array that retains references to the original objects, find() returns a direct reference to a single element. Being aware of these behaviors helps prevent unintended modifications to your data.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/js/referencebehavious/","summary":"Learn about reference types in JavaScript, including objects and arrays, and how methods like filter() and find() handle references.","title":"JavaScript Reference Behavior: Objects and Arrays"},{"content":"JavaScript Reference Guide 1.

Syntax: let objectName = { key1: value1, key2: value2, // more key-value pairs }; Example: let data = { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nirajan\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 20 }; 2. Array Explanation: Arrays are ordered collections of values. Values can be of any data type and are accessed by their index. Syntax: let arrayName = [value1, value2, value3, ...]; Example: let a = [\u0026#34;nirajan\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kirajan\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;birajan\u0026#34;]; 3. Function Explanation: Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. They can be invoked (called) to execute their code. Syntax: function functionName(parameters) { // code to be executed } Example: function outer() { console.log(\u0026#34;hi\u0026#34;); } outer(); // Output: hi 9. Array Methods 1. Indexing in Array Accessing Elements: Description: Arrays are zero-indexed, so the first element is at index 0. Returns: Value of the element at the specified index. Example: console.log(a[0]); // Output: 1 console.log(a[3]); // Output: 4 2. Slicing in Array Slicing: Description: Extracts a section of the array and returns it as a new array. Syntax: array.slice(startIndex, endIndex) Returns: A new array containing the elements from startIndex up to, but not including, endIndex. Example: console.log(a.slice(0, 2)); // Output: [1, 2] 3. Length of Array Description: Returns the number of elements in the array. Returns: Integer (length of the array). Example: console.log(a.length); // Output: 4 4. Push Description: Adds one or more elements to the end of the array. Returns: The new length of the array. Example: a.push(5); console.log(a); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 5. Pop Description: Removes the last element from the array. Returns: The removed element. Example: a.pop(); console.log(a); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] 6. Shift Description: Removes the first element from the array. Returns: The removed element. Example: a.shift(); console.log(a); // Output: [2, 3, 4] 7. Unshift Description: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array. Returns: The new length of the array. Example: a.unshift(0); console.log(a); // Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] 8. Join Description: Joins all elements of an array into a string, separated by a specified separator. Returns: A string representing the array elements joined by the specified separator. Example: let data = a.join(\u0026#34; \u0026#34;); console.log(data); // Output: \u0026#34;1 2 3 4\u0026#34; 9. Concatenation of Two Arrays Description: Merges two or more arrays into one. Returns: A new array containing the elements of the original arrays. Example: let a2 = [5, 4, 1, 3, 4]; console.log(a.concat(a2)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 1, 3, 4] 10. Sort Description: Sorts the elements of an array in place. Returns: The sorted array. Example: a2.sort(); console.log(a2); // Output: [1, 3, 4, 4, 5] 11. Reverse Description: Reverses the order of the elements in the array. Returns: The reversed array. Example: a2.reverse(); console.log(a2); // Output: [5, 4, 4, 3, 1] 12. Removing Elements from a Specific Position Description: Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements. Syntax: array.splice(index, numberOfElementsToRemove) Returns: An array containing the removed elements. Example: let newData = [1, 2, 3, 4]; newData.splice(1, 2); // Removes 2 elements starting at index 1 console.log(newData); // Output: [1, 4] 13. Inserting Elements at a Specific Position Description: Inserts elements into the array. Syntax: array.splice(index, 0, element1, element2, ...) Returns: An array containing the removed elements (empty if no elements were removed). Example: let lasrData = [1, 4]; lasrData.splice(1, 0, 2, 3); // Inserts elements 2 and 3 at index 1 console.log(lasrData); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] 14. Spread Operator (\u0026hellip;) Description: Spreads out elements of an array into another array or function arguments. Returns: A new array containing the elements spread from the original arrays. Example: let finalData = [...newData, ...lasrData]; console.log(finalData); // Output: [1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4] 15. Array Destructuring Description: Allows unpacking values from arrays into distinct variables in a concise and readable way. Basic Syntax: const [var1, var2, var3] = array; Example: const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; const [first, second, third] = numbers; console.log(first); // Output: 1 console.log(second); // Output: 2 console.log(third); // Output: 3 10. Object in Js i. Defining an Object An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key (also known as a property) is a unique identifier, and the value can be anything: a string, number, array, function, or even another object. Example:\nconst myObject = { name: \u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34;, // String property class: \u0026#34;Bachelor\u0026#34;, // String property is_topper: \u0026#34;No\u0026#34;, // Boolean property (as a string) greet: function (from) { // Method (function inside an object) console.log(`Welcome ${this.name}. From ${from}`); } }; ii. Accessing There are two common ways to access properties in an object:\nDot Notation: console.log(myObject.name); // Output: nirajan This is the most common and preferred method when you know the property name in advance. Bracket Notation: console.log(myObject[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;]); // Output: nirajan Bracket notation is useful when the property name is stored in a variable or when it contains special characters or spaces. iii. Modifying Object Properties You can modify an object\u0026rsquo;s properties using dot or bracket notation:\nDot Notation: Use when you know the property name.\nmyObject.name = \u0026#34;Kirajan\u0026#34;; // Modifies the \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; property Bracket Notation: Use when the property name is dynamic or contains special characters.\nmyObject[\u0026#39;class\u0026#39;] = \u0026#34;Master\u0026#39;s\u0026#34;; // Modifies the \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; property iv. Adding New Properties You can dynamically add new key-value pairs to an object.\nmyObject.lol = \u0026#34;lol\u0026#34;; console.log(myObject.lol); // Output: lol v. Using the this Keyword The this keyword inside an object’s method refers to the object itself, allowing you to access its properties. Example:\nconst person = { name: \u0026#34;Kirajan\u0026#34;, greet: function() { console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`); } }; person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Kirajan vi. Objects Inside Objects Objects can contain other objects, allowing you to create complex data structures. Example:\nconst a = { details: { name: \u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34;, age: 20 } }; console.log(a.details.name); // Output: Nirajan vii. Spread Operator (\u0026hellip;) The spread operator lets you copy, merge, or combine objects efficiently.\nCopying Properties: const original = { name: \u0026#34;Kirajan\u0026#34;, class: \u0026#34;Bachelor\u0026#34; }; const copy = { ...original }; console.log(copy); // Output: { name: \u0026#34;Kirajan\u0026#34;, class: \u0026#34;Bachelor\u0026#34; } Merging Objects: const info1 = { name: \u0026#34;Kirajan\u0026#34;, class: \u0026#34;Bachelor\u0026#34; }; const info2 = { age: 21, is_topper: true }; const combined = { ...info1, ...info2 }; console.log(combined); // Output: { name: \u0026#34;Kirajan\u0026#34;, class: \u0026#34;Bachelor\u0026#34;, age: 21, is_topper: true } viii. Object Destructuring Destructuring allows you to extract properties from an object and assign them to variables. Example:\nconst lol = { name: \u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34;, class: 12, rollno: \u0026#34;11\u0026#34; }; const { name, rollno } = lol; console.log(name); // Output: Nirajan console.log(rollno); // Output: 11 Also, Renaming in Destructuring: const lol = { name: \u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34;, class: 12, rollno: \u0026#34;11\u0026#34; }; const { name: studentName, rollno: studentRollNo } = lol; console.log(studentName); // Output: Nirajan console.log(studentRollNo); // Output: 11 ix. Object Methods Objects can have methods—functions that are properties of the object. These methods can perform actions using the object’s data. Example:\nconst calculator = { add: function(a, b) { return a + b; }, subtract: function(a, b) { return a - b; } }; console.log(calculator.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8 console.log(calculator.subtract(5, 3)); // Output: 2 11. JavaScript Functions Function Definitions: Function Expression: const add1 = function(a, b) { return a + b; }; Creates a function and assigns it to a variable. You call the function using the variable name. Arrow Function: const add2 = (a, b) =\u0026gt; { return a + b; }; Provides a shorter syntax and does not have its own this context. Function Declaration: function add3(a, b) { return a + b; } Defines a function with a name. It is hoisted, so it can be called before its declaration. Comparison: add3 has its own this context, while add1 and add2 do not. Using the Spread Operator: function add(...data) { let sum = 0; for (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; data.length; i++) { sum += data[i]; } return sum; } console.log(add(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6 The ...data syntax lets the function accept any number of arguments as an array.\nImmediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE): ( function add(a, b) { console.log(a + b); } )(2, 3); // Output: 5 An IIFE is a function that runs immediately after its definition, creating a local scope to avoid affecting the global scope.\n12. Control Flow in JavaScript Conditional Statements: if-else Statement: Executes code blocks based on a condition. let a = 2; if (a === 1) { console.log(1); } else if (a === 2) { console.log(2); } else { console.log(\u0026#34;None\u0026#34;); } Truthy and Falsy Values: Falsy Values: Values that evaluate to false in a boolean context. console.log(Boolean(false)); // false console.log(Boolean(0)); // false console.log(Boolean(-0)); // false console.log(Boolean(0n)); // false console.log(Boolean(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;)); // false console.log(Boolean(null)); // false console.log(Boolean(undefined)); // false console.log(Boolean(NaN)); // false Truthy Values: Any value that is not falsy. console.log(Boolean(true)); // true console.log(Boolean(1)); // true console.log(Boolean(-1)); // true console.log(Boolean(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;)); // true console.log(Boolean(\u0026#34; \u0026#34;)); // true console.log(Boolean({})); // true console.log(Boolean([])); // true console.log(Boolean(function() {})); // true console.log(Boolean(Symbol())); // true console.log(Boolean(1n)); // true Nullish Coalescing Operator (??): Provides a default value when dealing with null or undefined. let val1 = null; let val2 = val1 ?? 10; console.log(val2); // Output: 10 Ternary Operator (?:): A shorthand for the if-else statement. let c = 10; let b = 10; let largest = (c \u0026gt; b) ? c : b; console.log(largest); // Output: 10 13. Loops in JavaScript For Loop // Syntax: for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement) { ... } for (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; 10; i++) { console.log(i); } While Loop // Syntax: while(condition) { ... } let i = 0; while (i \u0026lt; 10) { console.log(i); i++; } Do-While Loop // Syntax: do { ... } while(condition); let i = 0; do { console.log(i); i++; } while (i \u0026lt; 10); For-Of Loop Usage: Iterates over arrays and strings const array = [1, 2, 3]; for (const x of array) { console.log(x); } For-In Loop Usage: Iterates over the properties of an object, indices of an array, or characters of a string const obj = { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nirajan\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lol\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lol\u0026#34; }; const arr = [\u0026#34;nirajan\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lol\u0026#34;]; const str = \u0026#34;mynameisnirajan\u0026#34;; for (const key in obj) { console.log(key); // Prints the keys of the object } for (const index in arr) { console.log(arr[index]); // Prints the values of the array } for (const index in str) { console.log(str[index]); // Prints the characters of the string } For-Each Loop Usage: Iterates over array elements const array = [1, 2, 3]; array.forEach((data) =\u0026gt; { console.log(data); }); Break and Continue Statements break: Exits the loop continue: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration 14. Map, Filter, and Reduce in JavaScript i. filter() Purpose: Creates a new array with elements that pass a test. Example: To get all odd numbers from an array: const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; const filtered = a.filter(num =\u0026gt; num % 2); // [1, 3, 5] ii. map() Method Purpose: map() creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. It’s used to transform each element in the array. Example: Create an array of squares from an existing array. const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; const squares = a.map((num) =\u0026gt; num * num); console.log(squares); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36] Here, the function num * num is applied to each element, resulting in a new array of squared numbers. iii. reduce() Method Purpose: reduce() executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. It’s used to accumulate or combine values from the array into a single result. Example: Sum up all the numbers in the array. const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; const sum = a.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =\u0026gt; accumulator + currentValue, 0); console.log(sum); // Output: 21 Here, accumulator starts at 0 and currentValue iterates over each element, summing them up. iv. Method Chaining Purpose: You can chain filter(), map(), and other array methods together to perform multiple operations in a single, readable statement. Example: Filter out odd numbers and then square them. const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; const result = a.filter((num) =\u0026gt; num % 2) .map((num) =\u0026gt; num * num); console.log(result); // Output: [1, 9, 25] Here, filter() first selects the odd numbers, and then map() squares those numbers, producing a new array with the squared values of the odd numbers. Summary filter(): Selects elements that meet a specific condition. map(): Transforms elements based on a function. reduce(): Reduces the array to a single value based on a function. Method Chaining: Combines multiple array operations in a concise and readable manner. These methods are powerful tools for processing and transforming arrays in JavaScript. 15. Importing and Exporting in JavaScript Default Export Only one default export is allowed per module. Use for the primary function, class, or object in a module. // utils.js export default function primaryFunction() { console.log(\u0026#34;This is the primary function\u0026#34;); } // main.js import primaryFunction from \u0026#39;./utils.js\u0026#39;; primaryFunction(); // Output: This is the primary function Named Export Allows multiple exports per module. Use to export multiple functions, variables, or objects. // utils.js function function1() { console.log(\u0026#34;This is function1\u0026#34;); } function function2() { console.log(\u0026#34;This is function2\u0026#34;); } export { function1, function2 }; // main.js import { function1, function2 } from \u0026#39;./utils.js\u0026#39;; function1(); // Output: This is function1 function2(); // Output: This is function2 Summary Default Export: One per module, no curly braces during import. Named Export: Multiple per module, use curly braces during import. 16. Error Handling Try-catch blocks are used to handle errors gracefully.\ntry { // Code that might throw an error let result = nonExistentFunction(); } catch (error) { // Code to handle the error console.log(\u0026#39;An error occurred:\u0026#39;, error.message); } finally { // Code that always executes console.log(\u0026#39;This always executes\u0026#39;); } // Output: // \u0026#34;An error occurred: nonExistentFunction is not defined\u0026#34; // \u0026#34;This always executes\u0026#34; 16.1. Custom Error Throwing You can throw custom errors using the throw statement.\nfunction divide(a, b) { if (b === 0) { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Division by zero is not allowed\u0026#39;); } return a / b; } try { console.log(divide(4, 2)); console.log(divide(4, 0)); } catch (error) { console.log(\u0026#39;Error:\u0026#39;, error.message); } // Output: // 2 // \u0026#34;Error: Division by zero is not allowed\u0026#34; 17. Timers setTimeout Schedules a function to be executed after a specified delay (in milliseconds).\nconst timeoutId = setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;Executed after 1 second\u0026#39;); }, 1000); setInterval Repeatedly executes a function at specified intervals (in milliseconds).\nconst intervalId = setInterval((a, b) =\u0026gt; { console.log(a); // Output: hi console.log(b); // Output: oi }, 20, \u0026#34;hi\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;oi\u0026#34;); clearInterval Stops a function from being executed repeatedly by clearing the interval.\nclearInterval(intervalId); clearTimeout Cancels a timeout previously established by setTimeout.\nclearTimeout(timeoutId); 18. Local Storage Local storage is a way to store data in the browser that persists even after the browser is closed.\nStoring Data localStorage.setItem(\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Nirajan\u0026#39;); Retrieving Data const name = localStorage.getItem(\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;); console.log(name); // Output: Nirajan 19. JSON JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.\nConverting Objects to JSON const person = { name: \u0026#39;Nirajan\u0026#39;, age: 20 }; const json = JSON.stringify(person); console.log(json); // Output: {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;:20} Converting JSON to Objects const json = \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Nirajan\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;:20}\u0026#39;; const person = JSON.parse(json); console.log(person.name); // Output: Nirajan 20. Fetch API Fetch is used to make HTTP requests and returns a promise that resolves to the response of the request.\nBasic Usage fetch(\u0026#39;https://api.example.com/data\u0026#39;) .then(response =\u0026gt; response.json()) .then(data =\u0026gt; console.log(data)) .catch(error =\u0026gt; console.error(\u0026#39;Error:\u0026#39;, error)); ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pages/js/javascript/","summary":"A complete reference guide for JavaScript including data types, functions, DOM manipulation, and modern ES6+ features","title":"JavaScript Reference Guide"},{"content":" Linux Commands and Directories Guide Important Directories Default Web Server Root Directory\nLocation: /var/www/html\nThis is the standard location for serving web content on Apache.\nDownloads Folder\nLocation: /home/username/Downloads\nThis is where files downloaded from the internet are usually saved by default.\nDocuments Folder\nLocation: /home/username/Documents\nA common directory for storing personal documents and files.\nDesktop Folder\nLocation: /home/username/Desktop\nThis is the location for files and shortcuts displayed on your desktop screen.\nCommon Commands cd Change the current directory to another one.\nUsage: cd [directory]\nExample: cd /var/www/html changes to the web server root directory.\nls List files and directories in the current location or specified path.\nUsage: ls [options] [path]\nExample: ls -l lists files in a detailed format.\npwd Print the path of the current working directory.\nUsage: pwd\nThis command shows where you are in the filesystem.\nsudo su Switch to the superuser (root) account, allowing you to perform administrative tasks.\nUsage: sudo su\nAfter entering your password, you\u0026rsquo;ll have root access.\nsudo Execute a command with elevated privileges.\nUsage: sudo [command]\nExample: sudo apt update runs the update command as an administrator.\nmkdir Create a new directory.\nUsage: mkdir [directory name]\nExample: mkdir new_folder creates a directory named \u0026ldquo;new_folder\u0026rdquo;.\ndir List files and directories, similar to ls.\nUsage: dir [options] [path]\nThis command can be used interchangeably with ls.\nmv Move or rename files and directories.\nUsage: mv [source] [destination]\nExample: mv /home/username/Downloads/file.txt /home/username/Documents/ moves the file to a different directory.\ncp Copy files or directories.\nUsage: cp [source] [destination]\nExample: cp /home/username/Downloads/file.txt /home/username/Documents/ copies the file.\nrm Remove files or directories.\nUsage: rm [options] [file/directory]\nExample: To remove a directory and its contents, use rm -r [directory].\ntouch Create an empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file.\nUsage: touch [filename]\nExample: touch newfile.txt creates an empty file named \u0026ldquo;newfile.txt\u0026rdquo;.\ncat Display the contents of a file in the terminal.\nUsage: cat [filename]\nExample: cat file.txt shows the content of \u0026ldquo;file.txt\u0026rdquo;.\ngedit Open the Gedit text editor to edit files.\nUsage: gedit [filename]\nExample: gedit notes.txt opens \u0026ldquo;notes.txt\u0026rdquo;
