# Inheritance Concepts in Python and C++

This document explores inheritance behavior differences between Python and C++ through various examples and cases.

## Case 1: All Public Variables with No Same Public Variable in Derived Class

### Python Implementation

```python
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "nirajan"
    
    def display(self):
        print("name is", self.name, "from a")
    
    def change_name(self, new_name):
        self.name = new_name + ' added in a'

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.doc = "rame"
    
    def display_a(self):
        self.display()
        print("name is", self.name, "from a")
        print("doc is", self.doc, "from b")
    
    def change_name_b(self, new_name):
        self.name = new_name + ' added in b'
        self.change_name(new_name)
        self.doc = new_name + ' added in b'

b = B()
b.display_a()
b.change_name_b("newname")
b.display_a()
```

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
    public:
        string name;
        A() {
            name = "nirajan";
        }
        void display() {
            cout << "name is " << name << " from a" << endl;
        }
        void change_name(string new_name) {
            name = new_name + " added in a";
        }
};

class B: public A {
    public:
        string doc;
        B() {
            doc = "rame";
        }
        void display_a() {
            display();
            cout << "name is " << name << " from a" << endl;
            cout << "doc is " << doc << " from b" << endl;
        }
        void change_name_b(string new_name) {
            name = new_name + " added in b";
            change_name(new_name);
            doc = new_name + " added in b";
        }
};

int main() {
    B b;
    b.display_a();
    b.change_name_b("newname");
    b.display_a();
    return 0;
}
```

### What Happens Here?

When we execute `display_a()`, it first checks if the `display_a()` function exists in class B. If found, it executes that function; otherwise, it looks for the function in class A. Since `display_a()` is found in class B, it executes that function.

Within `display_a()`, the first line calls `display()`. The system looks for this function in class B first. If not found, it searches in class A. Since `display()` is not in class B, it finds and executes the function from class A.

**In Python:**
While executing the display function, when it needs the `name` variable, it first looks for the variable in class B. If not found, it searches in class A.

**In C++:**
While executing the display function, when it needs the `name` variable, it first looks for the variable in the class that the function actually belongs to. Here, the display function belongs to class A, so it looks for the variable in class A, not in class B as in Python.

After finding the variable, the display function prints the variable value. In this case, both Python and C++ print the same value since the `name` variable is not present in class B. Python looks for the variable in class A and finds it there, while C++ looks in class A by default since the display function belongs to class A.

After the `display()` function, the next line of code is `cout << "name is " << name << " from a" << endl;`. Since this is in a function of class B:

**C++ behavior:** Looks for variable `name` in class B first, as it's in a function of class B. If not found, it looks in class A.

**Python behavior:** Always looks in the derived class first, so it searches for variable `name` in class B first. If not found, it looks in class A.

Both then print the value of variable `name` from class A.

The next line `cout << "doc is " << doc << " from b" << endl;` is also in a function of class B, so both C++ and Python find the variable `doc` in class B first and print its value.

## Case 2: Public Variable with Repetition in Derived Class

### Python Implementation

```python
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "nirajan"
    
    def display(self):
        print("name is", self.name, "from a")
    
    def change_name(self, new_name):
        self.name = new_name + ' added in a'

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "rame"
    
    def display_a(self):
        self.display()
        print("name is", self.name, "from b")
    
    def change_name_b(self, new_name):
        self.name = new_name + ' added in b'
        self.change_name(new_name)

b = B()
b.display_a()
b.change_name_b("newname")
b.display_b()
```

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
    public:
        string name;
        A() {
            name = "nirajan";
        }
        void display() {
            cout << "name is " << name << " from a" << endl;
        }
        void change_name(string new_name) {
            name = new_name + " added in a";
        }
};

class B: public A {
    public:
        string name;
        B() {
            name = "rame";
        }
        void display_a() {
            display();
            cout << "name is " << name << " from b" << endl;
        }
        void change_name_b(string new_name) {
            name = new_name + " added in b";
            change_name(new_name);
        }
};

int main() {
    B b;
    b.display_a();
    b.change_name_b("newname");
    b.display_a();
    return 0;
}
```

### What Happens Here?

Python and C++ behave differently in this case.

**In Python:**
In C++ the variable name in class A and B are two separate variables stored in different memory locations, but in Python, there is only one instance variable name per object. When class B's constructor sets self.name = "rame", it overwrites the single instance variable that belongs to the object.ie. B doesnt have different name variable in python instead it uses the same variable from A.

 When we call `display_b()`, it first checks if the function is available in class B. Since it's found in class B, it executes that function. The first line `self.display()` then it again checks for the display function in class B first. If not found, it looks in class A . Since it's not found in class B, it finds and executes the function from class A. While executing the function from class A, Inside the display function, it need variable `name`, so it first looks for the variable in class A. 
 The next line `print("name is", self.name, "from b")` is in a function of class B, but variable `name` is not found in class B, so it looks in class A and finds it there.since in B no duplicate variable is created as it uses the variable from class A.


 


**In C++:**
When we call `display_a()`, it first checks if the function is available in class B. Since it's found in class B, it executes that function. The first line calls `display()`, which searches for the display function in class B first. If not found, it looks in class A and finds it there, executing the class A function. While executing the function from class A, it uses the variable from class A, not from class B as in Python.

The next line `cout << "name is " << name << " from b" << endl;` is in a function of class B, so it uses the variable from class B.

When changing the name through `change_name_b()`, the first line `name = new_name + " added in b";` uses the variable from class B because it's in a function of class B. The next line `change_name(new_name);` looks for the function in class B first, then in class A, finding and executing the function from class A. While executing the function from class A, it uses the variable from class A, not from class B as in Python.

## Case 3: Private Variable Only in Base Class with No Same Variable in Derived Class

### Python Implementation

```python
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__name = "nirajan"
    
    def display(self):
        print("name is", self.__name, "from a")
    
    def change_name(self, new_name):
        self.__name = new_name + ' added in a'

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.doc = "rame"
    
    def display_b(self):
        self.display()
        print("doc is", self.doc, "from b")
        print("name is", self.__name, "from b")  # will give error
    
    def change_name_b(self, new_name):
        self.__name = new_name + ' added in b'  # will give error
        self.change_name(new_name)
        self.doc = new_name + ' added in b'

b = B()
b.display_b()
b.change_name_b("newname")
b.display_b()
```

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
    private:
        string name;
    public:
        A() {
            name = "nirajan";
        }
        void display() {
            cout << "name is " << name << " from a" << endl;
        }
        void change_name(string new_name) {
            name = new_name + " added in a";
        }
};

class B: public A {
    public:
        string doc;
        B() {
            doc = "rame";
        }
        void display_a() {
            display();
            cout << "doc is " << doc << " from b" << endl;
            cout << "name is " << name << " from b" << endl;  // will give error
        }
        void change_name_b(string new_name) {
            name = new_name + " added in b";  // will give error
            change_name(new_name);
            doc = new_name + " added in b";
        }
};

int main() {
    B b;
    b.display_a();
    b.change_name_b("newname");
    b.display_a();
    return 0;
}
```

### What Happens Here?

When running the `display_a()` function of class B, the first line `display()` searches for the display function in class B. If not found, it looks in class A, finds it, and executes it. In the `display()` function, we display the private variable of class A because we're using the function from class A.

The next line `cout << "doc is " << doc << " from b" << endl;` prints the variable from class B because it's in a function of class B.

However, the next line `cout << "name is " << name << " from b" << endl;` throws an error because it searches for `name` in class B first. If not found, it looks for the same variable in class A, but since it's a private variable, it's not visible to class B functions. The system can't see the declaration of `name` in class A and throws an error stating that `name` is not declared.

Similarly, when changing the name through `change_name_b()`, the first line `name = new_name + " added in b";` searches for the variable `name` in class B. If not found, it looks in class A, but since it's a private variable, it's not visible to class B functions, causing a "not declared" error.

The next line `change_name(new_name);` looks for the function in class B first, then in class A, finding and executing the function from class A, which uses the variable from class A.

## Case 4: Private Variable in Base Class and Same Private Variable in Derived Class

### Python Implementation

```python
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__name = "nirajan"
    
    def display(self):
        print("name is", self.__name, "from a")
    
    def change_name(self, new_name):
        self.__name = new_name + ' added in a'

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.__name = "rame"
    
    def display_b(self):
        self.display()
        print("name is", self.__name, "from b")
    
    def change_name_b(self, new_name):
        self.__name = new_name + ' added in b'
        self.change_name(new_name)

b = B()
b.display_b()
b.change_name_b("newname")
b.display_b()
```

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
    private:
        string name;
    public:
        A() {
            name = "nirajan";
        }
        void display() {
            cout << "name is " << name << " from a" << endl;
        }
        void change_name(string new_name) {
            name = new_name + " added in a";
        }
};

class B: public A {
    private:
        string name;
    public:
        B() {
            name = "rame";
        }
        void display_a() {
            display();
            cout << "name is " << name << " from b" << endl;
        }
        void change_name_b(string new_name) {
            name = new_name + " added in b";
            change_name(new_name);
        }
};

int main() {
    B b;
    b.display_a();
    b.change_name_b("newname");
    b.display_a();
    return 0;
}
```

### What Happens Here?

**In C++:**
When we call `display_a()`, it first checks if the function is available in class B. Since it's found in class B (and is public), it executes that function. The first line `display()` checks if the display function is available in class B. If not found, it looks in class A, finds it, and executes the function from class A. While executing the function from class A, it uses the variable from class A, not from class B as in Python.

The next line `cout << "name is " << name << " from b" << endl;` is in a function of class B, so it uses the variable from class B.

**In Python:**
While executing the display function (similar to case 2), it first looks for the `__name` variable in class B. The variable is present in class B but is private, so it's not visible when executing the function from class A. Therefore, it looks for the variable in class A, finds it there, and prints the value of the class A variable. The next line prints the value of the class B variable since it's in a function of class B.

When changing the name through `change_name_b()`, the first line `name = new_name + " added in b";` uses the variable from class B because it's in a function of class B. The next line `change_name(new_name);` looks for the function in class B first, then in class A, finding and executing the function from class A. While executing the function from class A, it uses the variable from class A, not from class B as in Python.

## Key Points

- Private functions can only be accessed from within the same class, not from outside the class
- Variable and function resolution follows different patterns in Python versus C++
- Python tends to look in the derived class first, while C++ considers the scope of the function being executed
- Private variables are not accessible across class boundaries in both languages



## 13. Comparison with Other Languages (Not Supported in Python)

### 13.1 Types of Inheritance in C++

Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class. While Python has a more straightforward inheritance model, other languages like C++ offer more granular control over inheritance:

- **Public Inheritance**: In public inheritance, the public members of the base class become public members of the derived class, and the protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class.

- **Protected Inheritance**: In protected inheritance, the public members of the base class become protected members of the derived class, and the protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class while the private members of the base class is not inherited.

- **Private Inheritance**: In private inheritance, the public members of the base class become private members of the derived class, and the protected members of the base class become private members of the derived class while the private members of the base class is not inherited.

Table of Inheritance in C++:
| Inheritance Type | Public Members | Protected Members | Private Members |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Public Inheritance | Public          | Protected         | Not Inherited    |
| Protected Inheritance | Protected     | Protected         | Not Inherited    |
| Private Inheritance | Private        | Private          | Not Inherited    |

This comparison helps understand the differences in how various languages implement OOP concepts.

### 13.2 Function overloading in C++
Function overloading is a feature in C++ that allows multiple functions to have the same name but different parameters (either in type or number). This is not supported in Python, as Python does not support function overloading based on parameter types or counts. Instead, Python uses default arguments and variable-length arguments to achieve similar functionality.

Example of function overloading in C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Math {
public:
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

};
int main() {
    Math math;
    cout << math.add(5, 3) << endl;          // Calls add(int
    cout << math.add(5.5, 3.3) << endl;      // Calls add(double, double)
    cout << math.add(1, 2, 3) << endl;        //calls add(int, int, int)
    return 0;
}
```

### 13.3 Static method in cpp
Static variables and static methods in C++ are associated with the class rather than any particular instance of the class. They can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.Static methods are defined using the `static` keyword and can be called using the class name.
Example of static method in C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Math {
public:
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};
int main() {
    cout << Math::add(5, 3) << endl;  // Calling static
    return 0;
}
```

Example of static variable in C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Counter {
public:
    static int count;  // Declaration of static variable
    Counter() {
        count++;  // Increment static variable in constructor
    }
};
int Counter::count = 0;  // Definition and initialization of static variable
int main() {
    Counter c1;
    Counter c2;
    Counter c3;
    cout << "Number of Counter objects: " << Counter::count << endl;  //
    return 0;
}
```
Here count variable is shared among all instances of the Counter class and can be accessed using the class name as well as through any instance of the class.Such that change of count variable in one instance will reflect in all other instances.



### 13.4 Use of `this` pointer in C++
`this` pointer is an implicit parameter to all non-static member functions. It points to the object for which the member function is called. It is used to access the members of the current object.

Use of this pointer in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Point{
    private:
        int x, y;
    public:
        Point(int x, int y){
            this->x = x;  // Using this pointer to refer to the current object's x
            this->y = y;  // Using this pointer to refer to the current object's 
            
            // here the parameter name and the member variable name are same so we use this pointer to differentiate between them
        }

        void display(){
            cout << "X: " << x << ", Y: " << y << endl;  // Direct access without this pointer as they are not ambiguous
        }

        void setX(int x){
            this->x = x;  // Using this pointer to refer to the current object's x
        }
    
}
```

### 13.5 Destructors in C++
A destructor is a special member function that is called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It is used to release resources that were allocated to the object during its lifetime. The
destructor has the same name as the class but is preceded by a tilde (`~`).
Example of destructor in C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Person {
public:

    Person() {
        cout << "Constructor called" << endl;
    }
    ~Person() {
        cout << "Destructor called" << endl;
    }
};
int main() {
    Person p1;  // Constructor called
    {
        Person p2;  // Constructor called
    }  // Destructor called for p2 as it goes out of scope
    // Destructor called for p1 as it goes out of scope at the end of main
}
```


## Summary

In this tutorial, we've covered the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Python:

1. **Classes and Objects**: The blueprint and instances that form the foundation of OOP
2. **Methods**: Adding behavior to our classes
3. **Constructors**: Initializing objects with specific attributes
4. **Access Specifiers**: Controlling visibility of class members
5. **Inheritance**: Creating class hierarchies for code reuse
6. **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: Understanding how Python resolves method calls in inheritance hierarchies
7. **Properties (Getters and Setters)**: Controlled access to attributes
8. **Special Methods**: Customizing object behavior
9. **Operator Overloading**: Defining operator behavior for custom objects
10. **Static and Class Methods**: Methods that operate at the class level
11. **Introspection**: Examining objects at runtime
12. **Nested Classes**: Classes within classes
13. **Comparison with Other Languages**: Understanding how Python's approach differs from other OOP languages

By understanding these concepts, you'll be able to design more efficient, maintainable, and powerful Python applications.
