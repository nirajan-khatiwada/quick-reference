# DML Commands Reference Guide

## What are DML Commands?

**DML (Data Manipulation Language)** commands are SQL statements used to manipulate data within database tables. The three primary DML commands are INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

---

## 1. INSERT Command

The INSERT command is used to add new records (rows) to a table.

### Syntax Variations:

#### Basic INSERT (All Columns)
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

#### INSERT with Specific Columns
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

#### Multiple Row INSERT
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES 
    (value1, value2, value3),
    (value4, value5, value6),
    (value7, value8, value9);
```

#### Multiple Row INSERT with Specific Columns
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES 
    (value1, value2),
    (value3, value4),
    (value5, value6);
```

### Examples:

```sql
-- Example 1: Insert into Students table (all columns)
INSERT INTO Students VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'Computer Science', 3.5);

-- Example 2: Insert with specific columns
INSERT INTO Students (student_id, name, major) VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 'Mathematics');

-- Example 3: Multiple row insert
INSERT INTO Students VALUES 
    (3, 'Mike Johnson', 'Physics', 3.2),
    (4, 'Sarah Wilson', 'Chemistry', 3.8),
    (5, 'David Brown', 'Biology', 3.6);

-- Example 4: Multiple rows with specific columns
INSERT INTO Students (student_id, name, major) VALUES 
    (6, 'Emily Davis', 'History'),
    (7, 'Robert Taylor', 'English'),
    (8, 'Lisa Anderson', 'Art');
```

## 2. UPDATE Command

The UPDATE command is used to modify existing records in a table.

### Syntax:

#### Update All Rows
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...;
```

#### Update with Condition (Recommended)
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;
```

### Examples:

```sql
-- Example 1: Update all students' GPA (dangerous - affects all rows)
UPDATE Students SET gpa = 3.0;

-- Example 2: Update specific student's information
UPDATE Students SET major = 'Computer Engineering', gpa = 3.7 WHERE student_id = 1;

-- Example 3: Update multiple students with condition
UPDATE Students SET gpa = gpa + 0.1 WHERE major = 'Computer Science';

-- Example 4: Update based on multiple conditions
UPDATE Students SET gpa = 4.0 WHERE name = 'Jane Smith' AND major = 'Mathematics';
```

## 3. DELETE Command

The DELETE command is used to remove records from a table.

### Syntax:

#### Delete All Rows (Dangerous)
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```

#### Delete with Condition (Recommended)
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### Examples:

```sql
-- Example 1: Delete all records (dangerous - removes all data)
DELETE FROM Students;

-- Example 2: Delete specific student
DELETE FROM Students WHERE student_id = 5;

-- Example 3: Delete students with condition
DELETE FROM Students WHERE gpa < 2.0;

-- Example 4: Delete with multiple conditions
DELETE FROM Students WHERE major = 'Physics' AND gpa < 3.0;
```
