## Parsers in Django
In Django REST Framework (DRF), parsers are responsible for parsing request data based on the Content-Type header of incoming requests. When a client (such as a web or mobile app) sends a request to a DRF API, it often includes data in different formats (JSON, form data, files, etc.). Parsers determine how that data is read and processed into Python data structures.

### 1. Built-in Parsers
By default , DRF will use the following parsers if you don't specify any:
- `JSONParser`: Parses JSON-encoded data (application/json)
- `FormParser`: Parses form-encoded data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded). This is typically used for HTML forms.
- `MultiPartParser`: Parses multipart form data (used for file uploads). 
- `FileUploadParser`: Parses file uploads in a more efficient way, especially for large files.
- `MultiPartParser`: Parses multipart form data (used for file uploads). 

### 2. How DRF determines which parser to use
DRF select the parser based on the `Content-Type` header of the incoming request. The order of preference is as follows:
- request.data trigger the DRF to:
    1. Check the `Content-Type` header of the request.
    2. Match it against the parsers defined in the `DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASSES` setting or the `parser_classes` attribute of the view.
    3. Convert the request body into a Python data structure using the selected parser.
    4. If no parsers match the `Content-Type`, DRF will raise a `ParseError`.


### 3.Setting Up Parsers
If we want to customize the parser or we dont want to use the default parsers, we can do so by setting the `DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASSES` in the settings.py file or by using the `parser_classes` attribute in a specific view.

***Global Setting***
You can configure parsers at the project level using DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASSES in settings.py:
```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.parsers.JSONParser',
    ]
}
```
This will set the default parser for all views in your project.

***View Level Setting***
You can also set parsers for individual views by using the `parser_classes` attribute in your view class.Not that when we define the `parser_classes` attribute in a view, it will override the global setting for that specific view.
```python
from rest_framework.parsers import JSONParser, FormParser, MultiPartParser
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ExampleView(APIView):
    """
    A view that accepts JSON data.
    """
    parser_classes = [JSONParser,FormParser,MultiPartParser]

    def post(self, request, format=None):
        return Response({'received data': request.data})
```


### 4.Individual Parser Classes In Detail
- **JSONParser**: 
    - Parses JSON request content. request.data will be populated with a dictionary of data.
    - .media_type: application/json

- **FormParser**:
    - Parses form-encoded data. This is typically used for HTML forms. request.data will be populated with a dictionary of data.
    - .media_type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    You will typically want to use both FormParser and MultiPartParser together in order to fully support HTML form data.

- **MultiPartParser**:
    - Parses multipart HTML form content, which supports file uploads. request.data and request.FILES will be populated with a QueryDict and MultiValueDict respectively.
    - You will typically want to use both FormParser and MultiPartParser together in order to fully support HTML form data.
    .media_type: multipart/form-data

- **FileUploadParser**:
    - Parses raw file upload content. The request.data property will be a dictionary with a single key 'file' containing the uploaded file.
    - If the view used with FileUploadParser is called with a filename URL keyword argument, then that argument will be used as the filename.
    - If it is called without a filename URL keyword argument, then the client must set the filename in the Content-Disposition HTTP header. For example Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=upload.jpg.
    .media_type: */*
    Notes:
    - The FileUploadParser is for usage with native clients that can upload the file as a raw data request. For web-based uploads, or for native clients with multipart upload support, you should use the MultiPartParser instead.
    - Since this parser's media_type matches any content type, FileUploadParser should generally be the only parser set on an API view.
    - FileUploadParser respects Django's standard FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS setting, and the request.upload_handlers attribute. See the Django documentation for more details.

### 5.Third-Party Parsers
- YAMLParser: Parses YAML-encoded data. You can use the `drf-yaml` package to add this parser.
- XMLParser: Parses XML-encoded data. You can use the `djangorestframework-xml` package to add this parser.
- MsgpackParser: Parses MessagePack-encoded data. You can use the `djangorestframework-msgpack` package to add this parser.


## Renderers in Django
Renderers in Django REST Framework (DRF) are responsible for converting the response data into the appropriate format based on the client's request. When a client makes a request to a DRF API, it may specify the desired response format using the `Accept` header or by including a file extension in the URL. Renderers determine how the response data is serialized and formatted before being sent back to the client.

### 1. How DRF determines which renderer to use
When a request is made to a DRF API, the framework will check the `Accept` header of the request to determine the desired response format. The order of preference is as follows:
    1. Check the `Accept` header of the request.
    2. Match it against the renderers defined in the `DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES` setting or the `renderer_classes` attribute of the view.
    3. Convert the response data into the appropriate format using the selected renderer.
    4. If no renderers match the `Accept` header, DRF will raise a `NotAcceptable` exception.
    5. if no accept header is provided, DRF will use the first renderer in the list of available renderers.

### 2. Default Renderers
By default, DRF will use the following renderers if you don't specify any:
- `JSONRenderer`: Renders data as JSON (application/json).
- `BrowsableAPIRenderer`: Renders a browsable HTML representation of the API. This is useful for testing and debugging.

### 3. Most Used Renderers
- **JSONRenderer**: Renders data as JSON. This is the default renderer in DRF and is used for most API responses.
    - .media_type: application/json
    - .format: json
    - .charset: UTF-8

- **XMLRenderer**: Renders data as XML. This is useful for APIs that need to support XML clients.
    - .media_type: application/xml
    - .format: xml
    - .charset: UTF-8
    - `djangorestframework-xml` package is required.

- **YAMLRenderer**: Renders data as YAML. This is useful for APIs that need to support YAML clients.
    - .media_type: application/x-yaml
    - .format: yaml
    - .charset: UTF-8
    - `drf-yaml` package is required.


### 4. Setting Up Renderers
You can configure renderers at the project level using `DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES` in settings.py and also at the view level using the `renderer_classes` attribute.

***Default Setting***
```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
        'rest_framework.renderers.BrowsableAPIRenderer',
    ]
}
```
This will set the default renderers for all views in your project.

***View Level Setting***
You can also set renderers for individual views by using the `renderer_classes` attribute in your view class. Note that when you define the `renderer_classes` attribute in a view, it will override the global setting for that specific view.
```python
from rest_framework.renderers import JSONRenderer
from rest_framework_yaml.renderers import YAMLRenderer
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ExampleView(APIView):
    """
    A view that accepts JSON data and returns YAML.
    """
    renderer_classes = [JSONRenderer, YAMLRenderer]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        data = {'message': 'Hello, World!'}
        return Response(data)
```


## Paginator in Django
To implement pagination in Django REST Framework (DRF), you can use the built-in pagination classes provided by DRF. Pagination is useful when you have a large dataset and want to limit the number of items returned in a single response. DRF provides several pagination classes that you can use or customize according to your needs.Types of Pagination:


There are two main types of pagination in DRF:

###  ***PageNumberPagination***: 
This is the default pagination style in DRF. It uses page numbers to navigate through the dataset. You can specify the number of items per page using the `page_size` attribute.

We can set this pagination :
-***Global Setting***
```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 10,  # Number of items per page
}
```
This will set the default pagination for all views in your project.

-***View Level Setting***
```python
from rest_framework.pagination import PageNumberPagination
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from .models import YourModel
from .serializers import YourModelSerializer
from rest_framework import generics

class YourModelPagination(PageNumberPagination):
    page_size = 10  # Number of items per page

class YourModelListView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = YourModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = YourModelSerializer
    pagination_class = YourModelPagination
```
This will set the pagination for the `YourModelListView` view only.ie overrides the global setting if defined.

```bash
GET /api/yourmodel/?page=2
```



###  ***LimitOffsetPagination***:
This pagination style mirrors the syntax used when looking up multiple database records. The client includes both a "limit" and an "offset" query parameter. The limit indicates the maximum number of items to return, and is equivalent to the page_size in other styles. The offset indicates the starting position of the query in relation to the complete set of unpaginated items.

We can set this pagination using 

-***Global Setting***
```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.LimitOffsetPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 10,  # defaule Number of items per page if limit is not provided
}
```
This will set the default pagination for all views in your project.


-***View Level Setting***
```python
from rest_framework.pagination import LimitOffsetPagination
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from .models import YourModel
from .serializers import YourModelSerializer
from rest_framework import generics

class YourModelPagination(LimitOffsetPagination):
    default_limit = 10  # Default number of items per page if limit is not provided

class YourModelListView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = YourModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = YourModelSerializer
    pagination_class = YourModelPagination
```
This will set the pagination for the `YourModelListView` view only.ie overrides the global setting if defined.

```bash
GET /api/yourmodel/?limit=10&offset=20
```
This will return 10 items starting from the 21st item in the dataset.
