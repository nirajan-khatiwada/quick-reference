## Deploying React App
to deploy the `react` app we need to build the app first and then deploy the build folder to the server.

### Build the App
To build the app run the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command will create a `build` folder in the root directory of the project.


### Deploy the App
We can deploy this to any static file server like `Netlify`,`Vercel`,`Github Pages` etc.
