## Using React Hook Form
As we have seen in the previous sections, managing form state and validation can be a complex task in React. However, with the introduction of libraries like React Hook Form, this process has become much simpler and more efficient.A react Hook Form is a library that helps you manage form state and validation in React applications with ease. It provides a simple API and integrates well with existing UI libraries.

### Installation
To get started with React Hook Form, you need to install it in your project. You can do this using npm :
```bash
npm install react-hook-form
```

### Basic Usage
To use React Hook Form, you need to import the `useForm` hook from the library and use it in your component. Here's a simple example of how to create a form with validation using React Hook Form:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import './App.css';
import { useState } from 'react';
const App = () => {
    const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors , isSubmitting} } = useForm();
    const [formData, setFormData] = useState(null);

    const onSubmit = (data) => {
        setFormData(data);
    };

    return (
        <div className="App">
            <h1>React Hook Form Example</h1>
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
                <div>
                    <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
                    <input type="text" id="name" {...register('name', { required: true,minLength: 10 })} />
                    {errors.name && <span>This field is required above 10 characters</span>}
                </div>
                <div>
                    <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
                    <input type="email" id="email" {...register('email', { required: true })} />
                    {errors.email && <span>This field is required</span>}
                </div>
                <button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>Submit</button>
            </form>

            {formData && (
                <div>
                    <h2>Form Data:</h2>
                    <div>Name: {formData.name}</div>
                    <div>Email: {formData.email}</div>
                    <div>isSubmitting: {isSubmitting ? 'true' : 'false'}</div>
                </div>
            )}
        </div>
    );
};
export default App;
```

### Explanation
- **useForm**: This hook provides methods to manage form state and validation.
- **register**: This method is used to register input fields and their validation rules.
- **handleSubmit**: This method is used to handle form submission.
- **formState**: This object contains the form state, including errors and submission status.
- **errors**: This object contains validation errors for each field.
- **isSubmitting**: This boolean indicates whether the form is currently being submitted.

### Validation
List of validation rules:
- `required`: This rule makes the field required.
- `minLength`: This rule sets a minimum length for the field.
- `maxLength`: This rule sets a maximum length for the field.
- `pattern`: This rule sets a regex pattern for the field.
- `min`: This rule sets a minimum value for the field.
- `max`: This rule sets a maximum value for the field.
- `validate`: This rule allows you to define custom validation logic.

we can use the combination of these rules to create complex validation logic.like 
```jsx
<input type="text" id="name" {...register('name', { required: true,minLength: 10 })} />
```

### Disable Prop
The `disabled` prop is used to disable the input field. This can be useful when you want to prevent users from interacting with the field until certain conditions are met.
```jsx
<input type="text" id="name" {...register('name', { required: true,minLength: 10 })} disabled={isSubmitting} />
```
### Conclusion
React Hook Form is a powerful library that simplifies form management and validation in React applications. It provides a simple API and integrates well with existing UI libraries, making it a great choice for developers looking to streamline their form handling process.
