Project 1:Create a card and inside card write a word "response" and animate it using framer motion in such a way that it should scale in x axis first then scale in y axis and after that it should stay like that for 1 second and then it should come back to its original position and this animation should repeat again and again with a delay of 0.5 seconds and below the card write "Make your animation work on all device" and add some shadow effect to it.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-black text-white h-screen w-screen items-center justify-center flex">

        <div className="text-6xl  max-h-48 font-semibold overflow-y-hidden  overflow-x-hidden tracking-widest break-words ">
          <motion.p
            initial={{ scaleX: 1, scaleY: 1 }}
            animate={{
              opacity: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
