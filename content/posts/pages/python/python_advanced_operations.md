# Python Fundamentals: Exploring Advanced Operations (Part 4)
In Python programming, advanced operations allow you to perform complex tasks efficiently. These operations include working with ranges, enumerations, zip functions, and more. In this guide, we will explore various advanced operations in Python to enhance your programming skills.

## 1. Ranges
Ranges in Python are used to generate a sequence of numbers. They are commonly used in loops to iterate over a specific range of values. Ranges can be created using the `range()` function.

### 1.1. Creating a Range
To create a range of numbers, you can use the `range()` function with the desired start, stop, and step values where start number is in inclusive and stop number is exclusive.

Example:
```python
# Generate a range of numbers from 0 to 9
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```bash
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

Example:
```python
# Generate a range of numbers from 1 to 10 with a step of 2
for i in range(0, 10,2):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```bash
0
2
4
6
8
```


### 1.2 Enumerate Function
The `enumerate()` function in Python is used to iterate over a sequence while keeping track of the index and value of each item. It returns a tuple containing the index and the value of the item.

Example:
```python
# Enumerate a list of fruits
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)
```

Output:
```bash
0 apple
1 banana
2 cherry
```

Example:

```python
a="nirajan"
for index, char in enumerate(a):
    print(index, char)
```

Output:
```bash
0 n
1 i
2 r
3 a
4 j
5 a
6 n
```


### 1.3. Zip Function
The `zip()` function in Python is used to combine multiple iterables (such as lists) element-wise. It returns an iterator of tuples where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the input iterables.

Example:
```python
# Zip two lists together
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
ages = [25, 30, 35]
for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(name, age)
```

Output:
```bash
Alice 25
Bob 30
Charlie 35
```

Example:
```python
a=[1,2,3]
b=[4,5,6]
c=[7,8,9]
print(list(zip(a,b,c)))
```

Output:
```bash
[(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]
```


### 1.5 Sorted Function
The `sorted()` function in Python is used to sort a list of elements. It returns a new sorted list without modifying the original list.The main feature of the sorted() function is that it can take a key argument that specifies a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons.

Example:
```python
# Sort a list of numbers
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)
```

Output:
```bash
[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

Example:
```python
# Sort a list of strings based on the length of the string
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
sorted_fruits = sorted(fruits, key=len)
print(sorted_fruits)
```

Output:
```bash
['date', 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```


Example:
```python   
#Sort an dictionary based on the value
d = {'apple': 10, 'banana': 5, 'cherry': 15}
sorted_d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
print(sorted_d)
```

Output:
```
[('banana', 5), ('apple', 10), ('cherry', 15)]
```


Example:
```python
#Sort a list of tuples based on the second element
t = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 6)]
sorted_t = sorted(t, key=lambda x: x[1])
print(sorted_t)
```

Output:
```bash
[(3, 1), (1, 2), (5, 6)]
```



#2. Import in Python
In Python, the `import` statement is used to import modules or packages into your script. It allows you to use functions, classes, and variables defined in other modules in your code.

### 2.1. Importing Modules
To import a module in Python, you can use the `import` keyword followed by the module name. You can then access the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module using dot notation.

Example:
```python
# Import the math module
import math

# Calculate the square root of a number
x = 16
print(math.sqrt(x))
```

Output:
```bash
4.0
```

Example:
```python
# Import the datetime module
import datetime

# Get the current date and time
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print(now)
```

Output:
```bash
2024-11-17 10:30:00
```

### 2.2. Importing Specific Functions
You can import specific functions or variables from a module using the `from` keyword. This allows you to use the imported functions directly without using the module name.

Example:
```python
# Import the pi constant from the math module
from math import pi

# Print the value of pi
print(pi)
```

Output:
```bash
3.141592653589793
```

Example:
```python
# Import the date class from the datetime module
from datetime import date
# Get the current date
today = date.today()
print(today)
```

Output:
```bash
2024-11-17
```

### 2.3. Aliasing Modules
You can alias a module or package by using the `as` keyword. This allows you to refer to the module by a different name in your code.

Example:
```python
# Import the math module and alias it as m
import math as m

# Calculate the square root of a number
x = 25
print(m.sqrt(x))
```

Output:
```
5.0
```

Example:
```python
# Import the datetime module using import and from and alias it as dt
from datetime import datetime as dt
now = dt.now()
print(now)
```

Output:
```bash
2024-11-17 10:30:00
```

### 2.4. Importing All Functions
You can import all functions and variables from a module using the `*` operator. This imports all the functions and variables defined in the module.

Example:
```python
# Import all functions from the math module
from math import *

# Calculate the square root of a number
x = 36
print(sqrt(x))
```

Output:
```bash
6.0
```


> The General Syntax is
>> `from module_name.submodule_name.submodule_name... import funtion_name or variable_name or filename as alias_name`


## random module
The `random` module in Python is used to generate random numbers. It provides various functions to generate random integers, floating-point numbers, and sequences.

### 1. Generating Random Numbers
The `random` module provides functions to generate random numbers within a specified range which can contain both integers starting and ending number.

Example:
```python
from random import randint
# Generate a random integer between 1 and 10
random_number = randint(1, 10)
print(random_number)
```

Output:
```bash
5
```

### 2.Shuffling a List
The `random` module provides a function to shuffle the elements of a list randomly. It modifies the original list in place.

Example:
```python
from random import shuffle
# Shuffle a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
shuffle(numbers)
print(numbers)
```

Output:
```bash
[3, 1, 5, 2, 4]
```
