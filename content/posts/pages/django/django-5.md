# Django Relations

In Django, there are three main types of relationships between models: OneToOne, OneToMany, and ManyToMany.

## Some Important Terms

- **`related_name`**: This attribute is used to define the reverse relation from the related model back to the model that defines the relationship.
- **`on_delete`**: It specifies the behavior to adopt when the object referenced by a foreign key is deleted.

### `on_delete` Options

- **`models.CASCADE`**: When the referenced object is deleted, also delete the objects that have a foreign key to it.
- **`models.PROTECT`**: Prevent deletion of the referenced object by raising a `ProtectedError` exception.
- **`models.SET_NULL`**: Set the foreign key to `NULL` when the referenced object is deleted.
- **`models.SET_DEFAULT`**: Set the foreign key to its default value when the referenced object is deleted.
- **`models.SET()`**: Set the foreign key to the value passed to `SET()` when the referenced object is deleted.
- **`models.DO_NOTHING`**: Do nothing when the referenced object is deleted.

> Note: In most cases, `models.CASCADE` is used.

## OneToOne Relation 

A OneToOne relationship establishes a unique connection between two models where each instance of one model corresponds to exactly one instance of another model. This relationship ensures data integrity by preventing multiple associations.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Each object can only be related to one other object
- Attempting to create multiple relationships with the same object will raise an error
- Commonly used for extending models or creating profile-like relationships

### Defining OneToOne Relations

You can define a OneToOne relation using `OneToOneField`:

```python
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()

class StudentProfile(models.Model):
    student = models.OneToOneField(
        Student, 
        on_delete=models.CASCADE, 
        related_name='profile'
    )
    address = models.TextField()
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=15)
```

**Important Notes:**
- The `related_name` parameter must be unique within the model
- It enables reverse access from the related model (Student to StudentProfile)
- The `on_delete=models.CASCADE` ensures that when a Student is deleted, their profile is also deleted

### Creating OneToOne Relations

### Method 1: Create with new objects
```python
student = Student.objects.create(name='John', age=20)
profile = StudentProfile.objects.create(
    student=student, 
    address='New York', 
    phone='1234567890'
)
```

### Method 2: Using existing objects
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
profile = StudentProfile.objects.create(
    student=student, 
    address='New York', 
    phone='1234567890'
)
```

### Updating OneToOne Relations

```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
profile = student.profile
profile.address = 'California'
profile.save()
```

### Accessing Related Objects

### From Profile to Student
```python
student_profile = StudentProfile.objects.get(address='California')
student = student_profile.student
```

### From Student to Profile (using related_name)
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
profile = student.profile
```

### Related Name Example

Here's another example demonstrating `related_name` usage:

```python
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()

class Book(models.Model):
    author = models.OneToOneField(
        Author, 
        on_delete=models.CASCADE, 
        related_name='book'
    )
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

Accessing the Book from Author:
```python
author = Author.objects.get(name='John')
book = author.book
```

### Querying Strategies

### Finding Student Profile by Student Name

**Method 1: Using field lookups with double underscores**
```python
student_profile = StudentProfile.objects.get(student__name='John')
```

**Method 2: Two-step approach**
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
student_profile = StudentProfile.objects.get(student=student)
```

**Method 3: Using related_name (most efficient)**
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
student_profile = student.profile
```

### Finding Student by Profile Address

**Method 1: Using reverse field lookups**
```python
student = Student.objects.get(profile__address='California')
```

**Method 2: Two-step query approach**
```python
student_profile = StudentProfile.objects.get(address='California')
student = Student.objects.get(profile=student_profile)
```

**Method 3: Direct relationship access**
```python
student_profile = StudentProfile.objects.get(address='California')
student = student_profile.student
```

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive `related_name` values that clearly indicate the relationship
- Consider the performance implications of your querying strategy
- Method 1 (field lookups) and Method 3 (direct access) are generally more efficient than Method 2 (two separate queries)
- Always handle potential `DoesNotExist` exceptions when querying for related objects
- Use `select_related()` for efficient querying when you know you'll need the related object

## OneToMany Relation

## Understanding OneToMany Relationships

A OneToMany relationship establishes a connection where one instance of a model can be related to multiple instances of another model, but each instance of the second model can only be related to one instance of the first model. This is also known as a "Foreign Key" relationship.

**Key Characteristics:**
- One record in the parent model can have multiple related records in the child model
- Each record in the child model can only belong to one parent record
- The relationship is defined using `ForeignKey` on the "many" side
- Common examples: Author → Books, Category → Products, Department → Employees

## Defining OneToMany Relations

You define a OneToMany relation using the `ForeignKey` field on the "many" side of the relationship:

```python
from django.db import models

class Subject(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()
    subject = models.ForeignKey(
        Subject, 
        on_delete=models.CASCADE, 
        related_name='students'
    )
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

**Important Notes:**
- `related_name='students'` allows reverse access from Subject to Students
- `on_delete=models.CASCADE` defines what happens when the referenced object is deleted

## Creating OneToMany Relations

### Method 1: Create objects and assign relationships
```python
# Create subjects
math_subject = Subject.objects.create(name='Mathematics')
science_subject = Subject.objects.create(name='Science')

# Create students and assign to subjects
student1 = Student.objects.create(name='John', age=20, subject=math_subject)
student2 = Student.objects.create(name='Jane', age=22, subject=math_subject)
student3 = Student.objects.create(name='Bob', age=21, subject=science_subject)
```

### Method 2: Create separately and assign later
```python
subject = Subject.objects.create(name='History')
student = Student.objects.create(name='Alice', age=19)

# Assign the relationship
student.subject = subject
student.save()
```

### Method 3: Using existing objects
```python
subject = Subject.objects.get(name='Mathematics')
student = Student.objects.create(name='Charlie', age=20, subject=subject)
```

## Updating OneToMany Relations

### Changing a student's subject
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
new_subject = Subject.objects.get(name='Science')
student.subject = new_subject
student.save()
```

### Updating the subject details
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
subject = student.subject
subject.name = 'Advanced Mathematics'
subject.save()
```

## Accessing Related Objects

### From Student to Subject (Forward Relationship)
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
subject = student.subject
print(f"{student.name} studies {subject.name}")
```

### From Subject to Students (Reverse Relationship)
```python
subject = Subject.objects.get(name='Mathematics')
students = subject.students.all()
for student in students:
    print(f"{student.name} studies {subject.name}")
```

## Querying Strategies

### Finding Students by Subject Name

**Method 1: Using field lookups with double underscores**
```python
students = Student.objects.filter(subject__name='Mathematics')
```

**Method 2: Two-step approach**
```python
subject = Subject.objects.get(name='Mathematics')
students = Student.objects.filter(subject=subject)
```

**Method 3: Using related_name (reverse relationship)**
```python
subject = Subject.objects.get(name='Mathematics')
students = subject.students.all()
# Or with filtering
students = subject.students.filter(age__gte=20)
```

### Finding Subject by Student Name

**Method 1: Direct access through relationship**
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
subject = student.subject
```

**Method 2: Using field lookups**
```python
subject = Subject.objects.get(students__name='John')
```

**Method 3: Using select_related for efficiency**
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
subject = Subject.objects.get(students=student)
```

# Django ManyToMany Relationship Guide

A ManyToMany relationship establishes a bidirectional connection where each instance of one model can be related to multiple instances of another model, and vice versa. This relationship is implemented using an intermediate junction table behind the scenes.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Each record in Model A can relate to multiple records in Model B
- Each record in Model B can relate to multiple records in Model A
- Django automatically creates an intermediate table to store the relationships
- No `on_delete` parameter is needed (relationships are simply removed, not cascaded)
- Example: A student can have multiple subjects, and a subject can have multiple students

## Defining ManyToMany Relations

You define a ManyToMany relation using the `ManyToManyField`. The field can be placed on either model, but conventionally it's placed on the model that makes more semantic sense.

```python
from django.db import models

class Subject(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()
    subjects = models.ManyToManyField(
        Subject, 
        related_name='students',
        blank=True  # Allows students with no subjects initially
    )
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

**Important Notes:**
- The `ManyToManyField` creates a hidden intermediate table
- `related_name='students'` allows reverse access from Subject to Students
- `blank=True` allows the relationship to be empty initially
- No `on_delete` parameter is required or allowed

## Essential Methods for ManyToMany Relationships

### `add()` Method
Adds one or more related objects to the relationship.

```python
# Add single subject
student.subjects.add(subject)

# Add a student to a subject
subject.students.add(student) # This is the reverse relationship

# Add multiple subjects
student.subjects.add(subject1, subject2, subject3)

# Add multiple students to a subject
subject.students.add(student1, student2, student3)

```

### `remove()` Method
Removes one or more related objects from the relationship.

```python
# Remove single subject
student.subjects.remove(subject)

# Remove a student from a subject
subject.students.remove(student) # This is the reverse relationship

# Remove multiple subjects
student.subjects.remove(subject1, subject2)

# Remove multiple students from a subject
subject.students.remove(student1, student2)

```

### `clear()` Method
Removes all related objects from the relationship.

```python
# Remove all subjects from a student
student.subjects.clear()

# Remove all students from a subject
subject.students.clear()
```

### `set()` Method
Replaces the current set of related objects with a new set.

```python
# Set specific subjects for a student
student.subjects.set([subject1, subject2])

# Set specific students for a subject
subject.students.set([student1, student2])


# Clear all relationships
student.subjects.set([])
```

## Creating ManyToMany Relations

### Step 1: Create the objects
```python
# Create subjects
math = Subject.objects.create(name='Mathematics')
science = Subject.objects.create(name='Science')
history = Subject.objects.create(name='History')

# Create students
john = Student.objects.create(name='John', age=20)
jane = Student.objects.create(name='Jane', age=22)
bob = Student.objects.create(name='Bob', age=21)
```

### Step 2: Establish relationships
```python
# John studies Math and Science
john.subjects.add(math, science)

# Jane studies Math and History
jane.subjects.add(math, history)

# Bob studies all three subjects
bob.subjects.add(math, science, history)
```

### Relationship Structure
After the above operations, the relationships look like this:
```bash
John → Mathematics, Science
Jane → Mathematics, History
Bob → Mathematics, Science, History

Mathematics → John, Jane, Bob
Science → John, Bob
History → Jane, Bob
```

## Accessing Related Objects

### From Student to Subjects (Forward Relationship)
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')

# Get all subjects for John
subjects = student.subjects.all()
```

### From Subject to Students (Reverse Relationship)
```python
subject = Subject.objects.get(name='Mathematics')

# Get all students studying Mathematics
students = subject.students.all()

```

## Updating ManyToMany Relations

### Adding new relationships
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
history_subject = Subject.objects.get(name='History')

# Add History to John's subjects
student.subjects.add(history_subject)
print(f"{student.name} now studies: {[s.name for s in student.subjects.all()]}")
```

### Removing relationships
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
science_subject = Subject.objects.get(name='Science')

# Remove Science from John's subjects
student.subjects.remove(science_subject)
print(f"{student.name} now studies: {[s.name for s in student.subjects.all()]}")
```

### Replacing all relationships
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='Bob')
new_subjects = Subject.objects.filter(name__in=['Mathematics', 'History'])

# Replace all of Bob's subjects with just Math and History
student.subjects.set(new_subjects)
print(f"{student.name} now studies: {[s.name for s in student.subjects.all()]}")
```

## Querying Strategies

### Finding Students by Subject Name

**Method 1: Using field lookups with double underscores**
```python
students = Student.objects.filter(subjects__name='Mathematics')
print(f"Students studying Mathematics: {[s.name for s in students]}")
```

**Method 2: Using reverse relationship**
```python
subject = Subject.objects.get(name='Mathematics')
students = subject.students.all()
print(f"Students studying {subject.name}: {[s.name for s in students]}")
```

**Method 3: With additional filtering**
```python
subject = Subject.objects.get(name='Mathematics')
young_students = Student.objects.filter(subjects=subject)
print(f"Young students studying {subject.name}: {[s.name for s in young_students if s.age < 21]}")
```

### Finding Subjects by Student Name

**Method 1: Direct access**
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
subjects = student.subjects.all()
print(f"{student.name} studies: {[s.name for s in subjects]}")
```

**Method 2: Using field lookups**
```python
subjects = Subject.objects.filter(students__name='John')
print(f"John's subjects: {[s.name for s in subjects]}")
```

**Method 3: Using filter ***
```python
student = Student.objects.get(name='John')
subjects = Subject.objects.filter(students=student)
print(f"{student.name} studies: {[s.name for s in subjects]}")
```
