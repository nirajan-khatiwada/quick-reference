# Advanced Django ORM Concepts

## 30. The N+1 Problem and Query Optimization

### What is the N+1 Problem?

The **N+1 problem** is a common performance issue that occurs when fetching a list of objects (N items), where each object needs related field data, causing Django to run:

- **1 query** for the base list
- **N queries** for related fields

 **Total = N+1 queries**

This happens because Django fetches related fields **lazily** by default.

### Using `django-debug-toolbar`
To identify N+1 problems, install and configure `django-debug-toolbar`. It shows the number of queries executed and their details.

### Example 1: Forward ForeignKey

```python
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

# This causes N+1 problem
books = Book.objects.all()
for book in books:
    print(book.title, book.author.name)  # N+1 queries!
```

**SQL Generated:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM book;                     -- 1 query
SELECT * FROM author WHERE id=...;      -- repeated for each book
```

If you have 1000 books → **1001 queries**! 

### Example 2: Reverse ForeignKey

```python
authors = Author.objects.all()
for author in authors:
    print(author.name, [b.title for b in author.book_set.all()])
```

**SQL Generated:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM author;                        -- 1 query
SELECT * FROM book WHERE author_id=...;      -- repeated for each author
```

If you have 200 authors → **201 queries**!

### Example 3: ManyToMany

```python
class Category(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    categories = models.ManyToManyField(Category)

books = Book.objects.all()
for book in books:
    print(book.title, [c.name for c in book.categories.all()])
```

**SQL Generated:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM book;                            -- 1 query
SELECT * FROM category JOIN book_categories... -- repeated for each book
```

If you have 500 books → **501 queries**!

### Fast Facts About Django ORM

When using operations like:

```python
Book.objects.filter(author__name='John Doe')
```

Consider the one-to-many relationship between Author and Book. Django will use **JOIN** clause to check the condition.

## 31. Solving N+1 with select_related

### When to Use select_related

- Works with **ForeignKey** and **OneToOneField**
- Uses **SQL JOIN** to fetch related objects in the same query
- Fetches related object in the **same query**

### Basic Usage

```python
# Solution: Use select_related
books = Book.objects.select_related("author")
for book in books:
    print(book.title, book.author.name)  # Only 1 query!
```

**SQL Generated:**
```sql
SELECT book.id, book.title,
       author.id, author.name
FROM book
INNER JOIN author ON book.author_id = author.id;
```

**Still 1 query total** even for 1000 books!


### Multiple select_related Fields

```python
# Multiple fields - still 1 query with multiple JOINs
Book.objects.select_related("author", "publisher", "editor")
```

 **Efficient** when all are FK/O2O relationships.

## 32. Solving N+1 with prefetch_related

### When to Use prefetch_related

- Works with **ManyToMany** and **reverse ForeignKey** relationships
- Django runs **2 queries** (base + related), then links results in Python
- Avoids **row explosion** (cartesian product)

### Basic Usage

```python
# Solution: Use prefetch_related
authors = Author.objects.prefetch_related("book_set")
for author in authors:
    print(author.name, [b.title for b in author.book_set.all()])
```

**SQL Generated:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM author;                      -- 1st query
SELECT * FROM book WHERE author_id IN (...); -- 2nd query
```

 **Always 2 queries**, regardless of author count.

### ManyToMany Example

```python
books = Book.objects.prefetch_related("categories")
for book in books:
    print(book.title, [c.name for c in book.categories.all()])
```

**SQL Generated:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM book;                                    -- 1st query
SELECT * FROM category 
JOIN book_categories ON category.id = book_categories.category_id 
WHERE book_categories.book_id IN (...);                -- 2nd query
```

### Multiple prefetch_related Fields

```python
# Each gets its own extra query
Book.objects.prefetch_related("categories", "tags", "languages")
```

**1 base query + 3 prefetch queries = 4 queries total**.


## 33. Query Optimization Summary Table

| Relation Type | Default (lazy) | With Optimization |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| FK (forward) | N+1 queries | `select_related` → 1 query |
| O2O | N+1 queries | `select_related` → 1 query |
| FK (reverse) | N+1 queries | `prefetch_related` → 2 queries |
| M2M | N+1 queries | `prefetch_related` → 2 queries |

### Important Notes

- The **order** of `filter()` and `select_related()` chaining **isn't important**:

```python
# These are equivalent
Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__gt=timezone.now()).select_related("blog")
Entry.objects.select_related("blog").filter(pub_date__gt=timezone.now())
```

## 34. Using `prefetch_related` and `select_related` Together

You can use both `select_related` and `prefetch_related` in the same query to optimize different relationships:

```python
entries = Entry.objects.select_related("blog").prefetch_related("authors")
```




## 35. GROUP BY

We can perform GROUP BY operation using the `values()` along with `annotate()` method.


```python
Models.objects.values('field1', 'field2').annotate(aggregation_function('field3'))
```
This means we are grouping by `field1` and `field2` and applying the aggregation function on `field3`.



```python
from django.db.models import Sum
sales_data = Sales.objects.values('name').annotate(total_sales=Sum('amount'))
```

This will group the sales data by the 'name' field and calculate the total sales for each name.


```python
from django.db.models import Avg
average_scores = Student.objects.values('grade').annotate(avg_score=Avg('marks__obtained'))
```
This will group the students by their grade and calculate the average score for each grade.


```python
from django.db.models import Count
customer_countryCount = Customer.objects.values('country').annotate(count=Count('profile__id'))
```
This will group the customers by their country and count the number of profiles for each country.



## 36. Transactions in Django ORM

Django provides powerful tools to manage database integrity in the presence of concurrent access. Two of the most important concepts are **transactions** and **row-level locking**. Using them correctly prevents race conditions, ensures data consistency, and allows safe concurrent updates.

### Understanding Transactions

A transaction is a logical unit of work treated as a single "all-or-nothing" operation in the database. Django exposes transactions through the `transaction` module.

#### The ACID Principles

Every transaction follows the ACID principles:

- **Atomicity:** All operations succeed, or none do.
- **Consistency:** Data remains consistent after the transaction.
- **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
- **Durability:** Committed changes persist even if the system crashes.

In Django, you use transactions via `transaction.atomic()`:

```python
from django.db import transaction

with transaction.atomic():
    # All operations here form one transaction
    wallet.balance -= 100
    wallet.save()
```

If any line inside the block raises an exception, **all changes are rolled back**.

### The Need for Row-Level Locks

Imagine an e-commerce website where two customers try to purchase the last unit of a product simultaneously. Without proper locking:

```python
# BAD: No lock — race condition!
product = Product.objects.get(id=1)
if product.stock > 0:
    product.stock -= 1
    product.save()
```

Two requests may read `stock = 1` at the same time. Both subtract 1, resulting in `stock = -1`. This is a **race condition**, a classic problem in concurrent systems.

### Django's `select_for_update`

Django provides row-level locking using `select_for_update()`. When combined with `transaction.atomic()`, it ensures that the selected rows are locked until the transaction is complete.

```python
from django.db import transaction

with transaction.atomic():
    product = Product.objects.select_for_update().get(id=1)
    if product.stock <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Out of stock")
    product.stock -= 1
    product.save()
```

**How it Works:**

1. Transaction begins (`atomic`)
2. Row is locked (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`)
3. Any other transaction trying to lock the same row **waits** until the first finishes
4. Transaction commits → lock released

### When to Use `select_for_update`

Use row-level locks when:

- Updating counters (like likes or votes)
- Managing financial transactions
- Reserving inventory
- Booking tickets or seats
- Scheduling tasks (to prevent double assignments)

### Practical Example: Wallet Transfer

A classic example is transferring money between two users:

```python
from django.db import transaction

@transaction.atomic
def transfer(sender_id, receiver_id, amount):
    sender = Wallet.objects.select_for_update().get(id=sender_id)
    receiver = Wallet.objects.select_for_update().get(id=receiver_id)

    if sender.balance < amount:
        raise ValueError("Insufficient balance")

    sender.balance -= amount
    receiver.balance += amount

    sender.save()
    receiver.save()
```

Without `select_for_update`, concurrent transfers could overwrite each other, causing **lost updates**.

### Concurrency Behavior

Consider two concurrent transactions:

```
T1: Locks row (wallet id=1)
T2: Tries to lock same row → waits
T1: Updates & commits → lock released
T2: Continues → reads updated balance
```

This ensures data integrity even under heavy concurrent load.


## 37. Bulk Create
Django's `bulk_create()` method allows you to efficiently insert multiple records into the database in a single query. This is much faster than creating and saving each object individually.
```python
# Example of bulk_create
new_books = [
    Book(title='Book 1', author=author1),
    Book(title='Book 2', author=author2),
    Book(title='Book 3', author=author3),
]
Book.objects.bulk_create(new_books)
```
This will generate a single SQL `INSERT` statement that inserts all three books at once, significantly improving performance compared to multiple individual inserts.

## 38. Bulk Update
Django's `bulk_update()` method allows you to efficiently update multiple records in the database in a single query. This is much faster than updating each object individually.
```python
# Example of bulk_update
books_to_update = Book.objects.filter(author=author1)
for book in books_to_update:
    book.price += 10
Book.objects.bulk_update(books_to_update, ['price'])
```
This will generate a single SQL `UPDATE` statement that updates all three books at once, significantly improving performance compared to multiple individual updates.
